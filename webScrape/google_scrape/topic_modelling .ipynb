       " \"Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo confirmed last week that they had opened an inquiry following allegations of high-level corruption reported by a consortium of media and international groups. Investigators from 18 countries, working with 19 media outlets and 5 nongovernmental organizations, spent months going through 3.5 million leaked documents to produce “Congo Hold-Up,” a stunning account of corruption under former president Joseph Kabila.The documents, obtained by Mediapart and the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa, are from BGFIBank Group (Banque Gabonaise et Française Internationale), a private bank allegedly used to channel millions of dollars’ worth of public funds to Kabila’s family and associates.Since November 19, “Congo Hold-Up” findings have been published almost daily, exposing a kleptocratic system that enabled the siphoning of state funds from Congo’s Central Bank, state-owned mining company Gecamines, the national electoral commission, and tax revenues.Kabila, his family, and close associates allegedly embezzled at least US$138 million dollars over five years between 2013 and 2018. They even allegedly stole United Nations payments intended for Congolese soldiers who contributed to peacekeeping operations in the Central African Republic.The trove of material also revealed evidence of fraud and bribery in Congo’s 2008 multi-billion dollar “deal of the century” with two Chinese state-owned mining companies. Sicomines, the joint venture formed to implement part of that deal, denied the allegations. Gecamines has not responded to the allegations.BGFI, in a statement released on November 24, decried the leak and questioned the authenticity of the documents, but “strongly condemn[ed] acts contrary to law and ethics that may have been committed in the past” within its Congo branch “and of which its employees could possibly have been perpetrators or complicit.”Although endemic corruption in Congo is common knowledge, the government’s lack of political will to investigate alleged wrongdoings and the opacity of financial operations have long enabled corrupt officials to enjoy impunity. However, with bank statements, contracts, emails, and transaction records on hand, “Congo Hold-Up” could provide sufficient evidence for prosecutions.Those responsible for financial crimes, as well as their international enablers, should be held accountable. In a country where one in three people is critically hungry and the government constantly neglects basic rights such as access to running water, electricity, health care, and education, justice for large-scale corruption is long overdue. \\xa0European Development Banks’ Link to Abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Palm Oil IndustryThe Impact of Lead Contamination on Children’s Rights in Kabwe, Zambia\",\n",

A leadership battle threatens reforms.The Kasulo cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Credit...Supported byBy Dionne Searcey and Eric LiptonPhotographs and Video by Ashley GilbertsonKASULO, Democratic Republic of Congo — A man in a pinstripe suit with a red pocket square walked around the edge of a giant pit one April afternoon where hundreds of workers often toil in flip-flops, burrowing deep into the ground with shovels and pickaxes.His polished leather shoes crunched on dust the miners had spilled from nylon bags stuffed with cobalt-laden rocks.The man, Albert Yuma Mulimbi, is a longtime power broker in the Democratic Republic of Congo and chairman of a government agency that works with international mining companies to tap the nation’s copper and cobalt reserves, used in the fight against global warming.Mr. Yuma’s professed goal is to turn Congo into a reliable supplier of cobalt, a critical metal in electric vehicles, and shed its anything-goes reputation for tolerating an underworld where children are put to work and unskilled and ill-equipped diggers of all ages get injured or killed. “We have to reorganize the country and take control of the mining sector,” said Mr. Yuma, who had pulled up to the Kasulo site in a fleet of SUVs carrying a high-level delegation to observe the challenges there.But to many in Congo and the United States, Mr. Yuma himself is a problem. As chairman of Gécamines, Congo’s state-owned mining enterprise, he has been accused of helping to divert billions of dollars in revenues, according to confidential State Department legal filings reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with a dozen current and former officials in both countries.Top State Department officials have tried to force him out of the mining agency and pushed for him to be put on a sanctions list, arguing he has for years abused his position to enrich friends, family members and political allies.Mr. Yuma denies any wrongdoing and is waging an elaborate lobbying and legal campaign to clear his name in Washington and Congo’s capital of Kinshasa, all while pushing ahead with his plans to overhaul cobalt mining.Effectively operating his own foreign policy apparatus, Mr. Yuma has hired a roster of well-connected lobbyists, wired an undisclosed $1.5 million to a former White House official, offered the United States purported intelligence about Russia and critical minerals and made a visit to Trump Tower in New York, according to interviews and confidential documents.Mr. Yuma met with Donald Trump Jr. there in 2018, a session the mining executive described as a quick meet-and-greet. Despite such high-level access during the Trump administration, he was barred just two months later from entering the United States.His grip on the mining industry has complicated Congo’s effort to attract new Western investors and secure its place in the clean energy revolution, which it is already helping to fuel with its vast wealth of minerals and metals like cobalt.Batteries containing cobalt reduce overheating in electric cars and extend their range, but the metal has become known as “the blood diamond of batteries” because of its high price and the perilous conditions in Congo, the largest producer of cobalt in the world. As a result, carmakers concerned about consumer blowback are rapidly moving to find alternatives to the element in electric vehicles, and they are increasingly looking to other nations with smaller reserves as possible suppliers.There is a chance that Congo’s role in the emerging economy could be diminished if it fails to confront human-rights issues in its mines. And even if Mr. Yuma works to resolve those problems, as he has pledged to do, it still may not be enough for new American investors who want to be assured the country has taken steps to curb a history of mining-industry corruption.Congo’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, has tried to sideline Mr. Yuma by stacking Gécamines with his own appointees, but he has been unwilling to cross him further. During an interview at his hillside palace in Kinshasa, Mr. Tshisekedi said he had his own strategy for fixing the country’s dangerous mining conditions.“It is not going to be up to Mr. Yuma,” he said. “It will be the government that will decide.”The standoff between Mr. Yuma and the president echoes power struggles that have torn apart African countries rich with natural resources in the past. How this one plays out has implications that reach far beyond the continent, as the global battle against climate change calls for a stepped-up transition from gasoline-burning vehicles to battery-powered ones.For Congo, the question boils down to this: Will Mr. Yuma help the country ride the global green wave into an era of new prosperity, or will he help condemn it to more strife and turmoil?Statues greet motorists at the main roundabout in a mining hub in Congo’s Copperbelt. One depicts an industrial miner in hard hat, headlamp and boots; another a shoeless, shirtless man in ragged shorts holding a pickax. They tell the story of the country’s dual mining economies: industrial and artisanal.High-tech, industrial mines run by global corporations like China Molybdenum employ thousands of people in Congo’s cobalt sector, and while they have their own problems, they are largely not responsible for the country’s tarnished reputation abroad.Players in the clean energy revolution are increasingly caught in a cycle of exploitation and greed over resources. At the center of it is the quest\\xa0for a prized metal: cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars.It’s a different story for the artisanal sector, where Mr. Yuma plans to focus the bulk of his stated reforms. Consisting of ordinary adults with no formal training, and sometimes even children, artisanal mining is mostly unregulated and often involves trespassers scavenging on land owned by the industrial mines. Along the main highway bisecting many of the mines, steady streams of diggers on motorbikes loaded down with bags of looted cobalt — each worth about $175 — dodge checkpoints by popping out of sunflower thickets.Unable to find other jobs, thousands of parents send their children in search of cobalt. On a recent morning, a group of young boys were hunched over a road running through two industrial mines, collecting rocks that had dropped off large trucks.The work for other children is more dangerous — in makeshift mines where some have died after climbing dozens of feet into the earth through narrow tunnels that are prone to collapse.Kasulo, where Mr. Yuma is showcasing his plans, illustrates the gold-rush-like fervor that can trigger the dangerous mining practices. The mine, authorized by Gécamines, is nothing more than a series of crude gashes the size of city blocks that have been carved into the earth.Once a thriving rural village, Kasulo became a mining strip after a resident uncovered chunks of cobalt underneath a home. The discovery set off a frenzy, with hundreds of people digging up their yards.Today, a mango tree and a few purple bougainvillea bushes, leftovers of residents’ gardens, are the only remnants of village life. Orange tarps tied down with frayed ropes block rainwater from flooding the hand-dug shafts where workers lower themselves and chip at the rock to extract chunks of cobalt.Georges Punga is a regular at the mine. Now 41, Mr. Punga said he started working in diamond mines when he was 11. Ever since, he has traveled the country searching Congo’s unrivaled storehouse for treasures underfoot: first gold, then copper, and, for the past three years, cobalt.Mr. Punga paused from his digging one afternoon and tugged his dusty blue trousers away from his sneakers. Scars crisscrossed his shins from years of injuries on the job. He earns less than $10 a day — just enough, he said, to support his family and keep his children in school instead of sending them to the mines.“If I could find another job, I’d do it,” he said. “I’m tired of digging.”On most days, hundreds of men trudge into this mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo wearing plastic headlamps and hoisting shovels in search of treasure underground: cobalt. Here’s the backstory →This pockmarked canyon was once a thriving village, until someone turned up a chunk of cobalt while doing construction around his home. It set off a frenzy for the metal, used in cellphones and electric vehicle batteries.The price of cobalt has skyrocketed in recent years, and the impact is clear in the cobalt-rich area near Kasulo. Trucks driving vats of chemicals rumble onto giant mines that produce hundreds of thousands of tons of ore.But regular people, and sometimes children, also grab a pickax and start digging. They’re known as artisanal miners, as opposed to industrial miners.Artisanal work can be dangerous, especially when deep tunnels collapse. Some people trespass on massive industrial mines, stealing the rocks they uncover and selling them at makeshift depots to international traders.The government of Congo is trying to clean up artisanal mining, formalizing mine sites with better safety rules and protections for workers. Some automakers and other corporations have also made safety pledges.For now, artisanal mining remains a huge part of the industry. As much as 30 percent of Congo’s cobalt production comes from artisanal mining. And it’s unclear whether Congo’s plans for reform will turn into reality.Read about the man leading Congo’s reform effort.Officials in Congo have begun taking corrective steps, including creating a subsidiary of Gécamines to try to curtail the haphazard methods used by the miners, improve safety and stop child labor, which is already illegal.Under the plan, miners at sites like Kasulo will soon be issued hard hats and boots, tunneling will be forbidden and pit depths will be regulated to prevent collapses. Workers will also be paid more uniformly and electronically, rather than in cash, to prevent fraud.As chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Yuma is at the center of these reforms. That leaves Western investors and mining companies that are already in Congo little choice but to work with him as the growing demand for cobalt makes the small-scale mines — which account for as much as 30 percent of the country’s output — all the more essential.Once the cobalt is mined, a new agency will buy it from the miners and standardize pricing for diggers, ensuring the government can tax the sales. Mr. Yuma envisions a new fund to offer workers financial help if cobalt prices decline.Right now, diggers often sell the cobalt at a mile-long stretch of tin shacks where the sound of sledgehammers smashing rocks drowns out all other noise. There, international traders crudely assess the metal’s purity before buying it, and miners complain of being cheated.Mr. Yuma led journalists from The Times on a tour of Kasulo and a nearby newly constructed warehouse and laboratory complex intended to replace the buying shacks.“We are going through an economic transition, and cobalt is the key product,” said Mr. Yuma, who marched around the pristine but yet-to-be-occupied complex, showing it off like a proud father.Seeking solutions for the artisanal mining problem is a better approach than simply turning away from Congo, argues the International Energy Agency, because that would create even more hardships for impoverished miners and their families.But activists point out that Mr. Yuma’s plans, beyond spending money on new buildings, have yet to really get underway, or to substantially improve conditions for miners. And many senior government officials in both Congo and the United States question if Mr. Yuma is the right leader for the task — openly wondering if his efforts are mainly designed to enhance his reputation and further monetize the cobalt trade while doing little to curb the child labor and work hazards.Bottles of Dom Pérignon were chilling on ice beside Mr. Yuma as he sat in his Gécamines office, where chunks of precious metals and minerals found in Congo’s soil were encased in glass. He downed an espresso before his interview with The Times, surrounded by contemporary Congolese art from his private collection. His lifestyle, on open display, was clear evidence, he said, that he need not scheme or steal to get ahead.“I was 20 years old when I drove my first BMW in Belgium, so what are we talking about?” he said of allegations that he had pilfered money from the Congolese government.Mr. Yuma is one of Congo’s richest businessmen. He secured a prime swath of riverside real estate in Kinshasa where his family set up a textile business that holds a contract to make the nation’s military uniforms. A perpetual flashy presence, he is known for his extravagance. People still talk about his daughter’s 2019 wedding, which had the aura of a Las Vegas show, with dancers wearing light-up costumes and large white giraffe statues as table centerpieces.He has served on the board of Congo’s central bank and was re-elected this year as president of the country’s powerful trade association, the equivalent of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The huge mining agency where he is chairman was nationalized and renamed under President Mobutu Sese Seko after Congo gained independence from Belgium in 1960. Gécamines once had a monopoly on copper and cobalt mining and, by the 1980s, was among the top copper producers in the world. Jobs there offered a good salary, health care and schooling for employees’ families.But Mobutu, who ruled for 32 years, raided its funds to support himself and his cronies, a pattern followed by his successors, according to anti-corruption groups. By the 1990s, production from Gécamines had declined dramatically. Money wasn’t reinvested into operations, and the agency amassed debt of more than $1 billion. Eventually, half of its work force was laid off.To survive, Gécamines was restructured, turning to joint ventures with private, mostly foreign, investors in which the agency had a minority stake.Mr. Yuma took over in 2010, promising to return Gécamines to its former glory. But instead, according to anti-corruption groups, mining revenues soon disappeared. The Carter Center, a nonprofit, estimated that between 2011 and 2014 alone some $750 million vanished from Gécamines’ coffers, placing the blame in part on Mr. Yuma.The winners of Gécamines’ partnership deals under Mr. Yuma included Dan Gertler, a billionaire diamond dealer from Israel. Mr. Gertler was later put under U.S. sanctions for “hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals,” according to the Treasury Department.A confidential investigative report that was submitted to the State Department and Treasury and obtained by The Times accuses Mr. Yuma of nepotism, holding stakes in textile and food-importing businesses that got funding from a government agency he helped oversee, and steering work to a mining contractor in which he was alleged to have shares.American authorities also believed that Mr. Yuma was using some of the mining-sector money to help prop up supporters of Joseph Kabila, the kleptocratic president of Congo for 18 years who had first put him in charge of Gécamines.“Suspicious financial transactions appeared to coincide with the country’s electoral cycles,” said the State Department’s 2018 annual report on human rights in Congo, crediting the Carter Center for the research.By his own tally, Mr. Yuma has been accused of cheating Congo out of some $8.8 billion, an amount he thinks is absurd, saying he has brought in billions of dollars in revenue to the country.Mr. Yuma has launched a bombastic counterattack on watchdog groups and his critics, calling them “new colonialists.” He has claimed that they somehow conspired with mining companies to stymie his efforts to revamp the industry, which, in his assessment, has left “the Congolese population in a form of modern slavery.”Mr. Yuma also sent The Times a 33-page document outlining his defense, noting the many “veritable smear campaigns that seek to sully his reputation and blur his major role in favor of the country through the reform of its mining policy.”The room was packed. Top White House and State Department officials, mining executives, Senate staffers and other Washington elites sat rapt one day in 2018 at the D.C. headquarters of a foreign policy group as the microphone was handed to the guest of honor: Mr. Yuma.“We understand President Donald Trump’s desire to diversify and secure the U.S. supply chain,” he said, speaking to the Atlantic Council. “It would be of our best interests to consider partnerships with American companies to develop projects for the supply of these minerals.”Accused at home of pillaging the country’s revenues, Mr. Yuma had taken his image-cleansing campaign abroad, seeking redemption by convincing Washington that he was a critical link to Congo’s minerals and metals.Mr. Yuma’s team of lobbyists and lawyers included Joseph Szlavik, who had served in the White House under President George Bush, and Erich Ferrari, a prominent sanctions lawyer.Lodging at the Four Seasons, he held meetings on two trips that spring with officials from the World Bank and the Departments of Defense, Energy and the Interior. He also traveled to New York, where he met with Donald Trump Jr.There, he was accompanied by Gentry Beach, a Texas hedge fund manager who was a major campaign fund-raiser for the former president as well as a close friend and erstwhile business partner of the younger Mr. Trump. Mr. Beach has been trying to secure a mining deal in Congo, and was previously invested with Mr. Trump in a mining project there. He did not respond to requests for comment.“Someone wanted to introduce me to say hello,” Mr. Yuma said, playing down the exchange with the president’s son.Mr. Trump said he did not recall the meeting.Through all the encounters, Mr. Yuma said, he recited the same message: American needed him, and he was ready to help.In Washington, he even offered what he considered crucial intelligence about Russia’s efforts to acquire Congolese niobium, a shiny white metal that resists corrosion and can handle super-high temperatures like those found in fighter jet engines. Mr. Yuma said he had helped thwart the sale to benefit the United States, according to two American officials involved in the meeting.Signs of trouble emerged during one of the trips. A member of his lobbying team was pulled aside by a State Department official and given a stark warning. Mr. Yuma was now a target of a corruption investigation by the United States, and he was about to be punished.A few weeks later, in June 2018, the State Department formally prohibited him from returning to the United States.“Today’s actions send a strong signal that the U.S. government is committed to fighting corruption,” the State Department said in a statement at the time that did not name Mr. Yuma, and instead said the actions involved “several senior” officials from Congo, which The Times confirmed included Mr. Yuma.For Mr. Yuma, the action signaled that he needed even more muscle. He would hire Herman Cohen, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs under Mr. Bush, and George Denison, who had worked for President Gerald Ford.A former Congolese airline and telephone executive named Joseph Gatt, who lives in Virginia and is close to Mr. Yuma, also took up his cause. Mr. Gatt stationed a personal aide at the Fairmont, a luxury hotel about a mile from the White House, who organized meetings with the lobbyists to push for permission for Mr. Yuma to visit the United States.“He’s a very formidable person,” Mr. Gatt said of Mr. Yuma in an interview, insisting that the allegations against him were false and that he was “quite clean.”At the same time, Mr. Yuma worked on elevating his standing in Congo. He hatched a plan with the exiting president, Mr. Kabila: Mr. Yuma would act as his proxy by becoming prime minister, State Department officials told The Times.But a top American diplomat was sent to meet with Mr. Yuma at his home in Kinshasa to make clear that the United States strongly objected to the plan, according to an interview with the diplomat, J. Peter Pham. After pulling out a bottle of Cristal Champagne, Mr. Yuma talked with Mr. Pham about political events in Congo, but things soon turned sour.Mr. Pham, then a special envoy to the region, told Mr. Yuma that the Americans were prepared to deport two of his daughters, who were completing graduate degrees in the United States, if he pursued Mr. Kabila’s scheme.“If we revoked your visa, we could revoke theirs,” Mr. Pham recalled telling Mr. Yuma.Mr. Yuma was undeterred, and his team recruited an aide to Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, to deliver an invitation for Mr. Yuma to visit the United States and discuss his work in Congo. The invitation was even shared with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, though the State Department shut it down. “We saw it for what it was: an attempt to get around the visa ban,” Mr. Pham said.Still determined to get his way, Mr. Yuma bolstered his collection of influencers. Mr. Denison briefly joined the Washington lobbying team with instructions to ensure that Mr. Yuma could travel to the United States and that he “not face legal sanctions,” a June 2020 email shows. The United States was considering putting Mr. Yuma on a sanctions list, according to State Department officials, a move that could freeze money he had in international banks.But a $3 million contract between the men did not mention that assignment, instead saying that Mr. Denison was to “promote the attractiveness of the business climate” in Congo, according to a copy of the document.Shortly after he started the work, Mr. Denison received $1.5 million, emails show, with instructions to transfer most of it to an account belonging to an associate of Mr. Yuma’s. The transaction drew scrutiny from the bank — and alarm bells went off for Mr. Denison, who said he was concerned that he might be unknowingly participating in a money-laundering scheme.Mr. Denison hired a lawyer, quit the job and ultimately returned all the funds.“He’s a huge crook,” Mr. Denison said.Mr. Yuma did not respond to a question on the matter.President Tshisekedi and Mr. Yuma walked near a large terraced canyon at one of Glencore’s cobalt mines in the Copperbelt, a region so defined by mining that roadside markets sell steel-toed boots and hard hats alongside fresh eggs and spears of okra.The outing in May was awkward for these two political rivals.Mr. Tshisekedi, a longtime opposition member who took office in early 2019 in a disputed election, has been fully embraced by the Biden administration, which sees him as an ally in battling global warming. He is chairman of the African Union and has repeatedly appeared with Mr. Biden at international events, including a meeting in Rome last month and then again a few days later in Glasgow at the global climate conference.Back home, Mr. Tshisekedi has announced that he intends to make Congo “the world capital for strategic minerals.” But some Congolese and American officials think that in order for that to happen, Mr. Yuma needs to be ousted.“We have continuously tried to apply pressure” to have Mr. Yuma removed, said one State Department official. Yet Mr. Yuma “retains considerable influence,” the official said, baffling the State Department.Meanwhile, Mr. Yuma is carrying on as usual, trailed by an entourage of aides who address him as President Yuma, as he is known throughout much of Congo for his business leadership. It is also a nod to his power base and ambitions.He talks of installing seven new floors and a helipad at his office building in downtown Kinshasa. He even had one of his lobbyists track down Mr. Tshisekedi in September in New York, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting, to press him to stand by Mr. Yuma.In Congo, Mr. Yuma also embarked on a nationwide tour this year that looked a lot like a campaign for public office. He set out to visit every province, strategically making his first stop in Mr. Tshisekedi’s hometown, where he met with a group of struggling pineapple juice sellers.Before leaving, he handed the group $5,000 in cash to jump-start their business.“Just to show them that I’m supportive,” he explained in an interview.Like the president, Mr. Yuma is hoping to get credit for attracting more U.S. investors, convinced that his reform efforts will turn the tide.“I’m a friend of America,” he said in the interview. “I always work in good will to protect and to help the U.S. invest in D.R.C. And I told you, I love America. My children were at university there. One of these days, people will understand I’m a real good friend of America and I will continue to help.”If his success depends on transforming the mining sector, the task will be formidable.All day long on a main highway that runs through dozens of industrial mines, trucks groan with loads of copper and tubs of chemicals used to extract metals from ore.But snaking between them is motorcycle after motorcycle, with one man driving and one sitting backward, acting as a lookout, atop huge bags of stolen cobalt.Dionne Searcey reported from Kasulo, and Eric Lipton from Washington.

The song addresses Étienne Tshisekedi, the president’s dead father, a firebrand opposition leader, by his nickname. It laments his son’s incompetence.In the video, Mr Elvis raps to a photo of Mr Tshisekedi senior, surrounded by flickering candles. He repeats the refrain “since you left” and describes the country’s woes, from the scarcity of clean water to the abundance of corruption, electoral fraud and conflict. “Since you left, war in the east goes on,” he raps. “We are fighting for the rule of law.”The Censorship Commission banned another six of Mr Elvis’s songs as well as a track called “What we have not done” by MPR, a hip-hop group. This song is about the failings of every Congolese president since independence. The ban on MPR’s track was rescinded a day later when fans kicked up a fuss.Mr Elvis has not been so lucky. Broadcasters that play his forbidden tracks risk having their licences revoked. Other musicians have been targeted, too. A rapper from southern Congo, Sébastien Lumbwe, known as “Infrapa”, fled the country two weeks ago after being harassed by officials over his songs, which poke the government. “It is part of a pattern of shrinking civic space,” says Jean-Mobert Senga of Amnesty International, a watchdog. “It goes against President Tshisekedi’s commitment to respect human rights.”The legal authority to ban the songs comes from a decree issued by a crooked dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, 54 years ago. The current president’s father, were he still alive, would be appalled. He spent much of his life campaigning against Mobutu’s champagne-gargling tyranny. Now his son is using the kleptocrat’s diktat to stifle dissidents of his father’s sort, albeit funkier.Still, the Congolese government has not yet figured out how to make censorship effective in an age of social media. Although Mr Elvis says he is incensed by the ban, he is probably quite pleased about the buzz it has created. “Letter to Ya Tshitshi” has received more than four times as many hits on YouTube as some of his other recent tracks. It sounds tinnier played out of mobile phones than on the radio, but at least it is not a flop. Unlike the government that banned it.This article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \"Zapping the rap\"A daily newsletter with the best of our journalismThe digital revolution will be grounded in fibre, steel and concreteThe podium celebration will be under heavy scrutinyChina’s lending is slowing, even as the West is promising moreThe digital revolution will be grounded in fibre, steel and concreteThe podium celebration will be under heavy scrutinyChina’s lending is slowing, even as the West is promising moreThe unrest is a reminder of what the country could gain from a dealSouth Africans feel unjustly punished for their country’s scientific rigourPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” Copyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2021.

Now a Chinese mining conglomerate has bought it, and is racing to retrieve its buried treasure: millions of tons of cobalt.At 73, Kyahile Mangi has lived here long enough to predict the path ahead. Once the blasting starts, the walls of mud-brick homes will crack. Chemicals will seep into the river where women do laundry and dishes while worrying about hippo attacks. Soon a manager from the mine will announce that everyone needs to be relocated.“We know our ground is rich,” said Mr. Mangi, a village chief who also knows residents will share little of the mine’s wealth.This wooded stretch of southeast Democratic Republic of Congo, called Kisanfu, holds one of the largest and purest untapped reserves of cobalt in the world.The gray metal, typically extracted from copper deposits, has historically been of secondary interest to miners. But demand is set to explode worldwide because it is used in electric-car batteries, helping them run longer without a charge.Outsiders discovering — and exploiting — the natural resources of this impoverished Central African country are following a tired colonial-era pattern. The United States turned to Congo for uranium to help build the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and then spent decades, and billions of dollars, seeking to protect its mining interests here.Now, with more than two-thirds of the world’s cobalt production coming from Congo, the country is once again taking center stage as major automakers commit to battling climate change by transitioning from gasoline-burning vehicles to battery-powered ones. The new automobiles rely on a host of minerals and metals often not abundant in the United States or the oil-rich Middle East, which sustained the last energy era.But the quest for Congo’s cobalt has demonstrated how the clean energy revolution, meant to save the planet from perilously warming temperatures in an age of enlightened self-interest, is caught in a familiar cycle of exploitation, greed and gamesmanship that often puts narrow national aspirations above all else, an investigation by The New York Times found.The Times dispatched reporters across three continents drawn into the competition for cobalt, a relatively obscure raw material that along with lithium, nickel and graphite has gained exceptional value in a world trying to set fossil fuels aside.More than 100 interviews and thousands of pages of documents show that the race for cobalt has set off a power struggle in Congo, a storehouse of these increasingly prized resources, and lured foreigners intent on dominating the next epoch in global energy.In particular, a rivalry between China and the United States could have far-reaching implications for the shared goal of safeguarding the earth. At least here in Congo, China is so far winning that contest, with both the Obama and Trump administrations having stood idly by as a company backed by the Chinese government bought two of the country’s largest cobalt deposits over the past five years.As the significance of those purchases becomes clearer, China and the United States have entered a new “Great Game” of sorts. This past week, during a visit promoting electric vehicles at a General Motors factory in Detroit, President Biden acknowledged the United States had lost some ground. “We risked losing our edge as a nation, and China and the rest of the world are catching up,” he said. “Well, we’re about to turn that around in a big, big way.”Where Clean Energy Metals Are ProducedProduction of key resources is highly concentrated today.

In response, the United States is pressing for access to cobalt supplies from allies, including Australia and Canada, according to a national security official with knowledge of the matter.American automakers like Ford, General Motors and Tesla buy cobalt battery components from suppliers that depend in part on Chinese-owned mines in Congo. A Tesla longer-range vehicle requires about 10 pounds of cobalt, more than 400 times the amount in a cellphone.Already, tensions over minerals and metals are rattling the electric vehicle market.Deadly rioting in July near a port in South Africa, where much of Congo’s cobalt is exported to China and elsewhere, caused a global jump in the metal’s prices, a surge that only worsened through the rest of the year.Last month, the mining industry’s leading forecaster said the rising cost of raw materials was likely to drive up battery costs for the first time in years, threatening to disrupt automakers’ plans to attract customers with competitively priced electric cars.Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, said the mineral supply crunch needed to be confronted.“We have to solve these things,” he said at an event in September, “and we don’t have much time.”Automakers like Ford are spending billions of dollars to build their own battery plants in the United States, and are rushing to curb the need for newly mined cobalt by developing lithium iron phosphate substitutes or turning to recycling. As a result, a Ford spokeswoman said, “we do not see cobalt as a constraining issue.”Increased mining and refining of cobalt by Chinese companies has helped meet the growing demand and advanced the fight against climate change. But as more electric vehicles are produced by more automakers worldwide, the International Energy Agency expects a cobalt shortage by 2030, based on an analysis of existing mines and those under construction. Other forecasters say a shortage could hit as soon as 2025.The worldwide shift to electric vehicles is critical in the fight against climate change. Come along as the most important part of these cars, the battery, is made from components around the world → It all starts with metals and minerals. Prized cobalt mostly comes from mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Nickel is largely gathered in Indonesia and the Philippines; lithium in Argentina, Australia and Chile. The metals and other ingredients are\\xa0 used to make the battery’s electrodes.Much of this work is done in China, which is far ahead of the U.S. in building batteries. A Tesla Model Y, in one recent configuration, had 4,416 battery cells, which it makes at its so-called Gigafactories in the U.S. The battery cells represent nearly one-third of the car’s cost.American automakers like GM often buy battery cells from a South Korean-based supplier, though they are trying to move manufacturing to the U.S. But the minerals needed to make them will continue to depend on overseas supply.Read more about the clean energy revolution and the race between the U.S. and China to secure key resources.A review by The Times of documents filed with regulatory authorities in China shows the acquisitions in Congo have followed a disciplined playbook, announced with great fanfare by Beijing in 2015, to dominate the world’s emerging clean energy economy.As of last year, 15 of the 19 cobalt-producing mines in Congo were owned or financed by Chinese companies, according to a data analysis by The Times and Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The biggest alternative to Chinese operators is Glencore, a Switzerland-based company that runs two of the largest cobalt mines there.These Chinese companies have received at least $12 billion in loans and other financing from state-backed institutions, and are likely to have drawn billions more. In fact, the five biggest Chinese mining companies in Congo had lines of credit from state-backed banks that totaled $124 billion, according to the documents reviewed by The Times, even though one of them, China Molybdenum, described itself as “a pure business entity” traded on two stock exchanges.China’s goal is to control the global supply chain from the metals in the ground to the batteries themselves, no matter where the vehicles are made. The approach, in part, echoes Henry Ford’s investments in Amazonian rubber plantations as the auto industry turned to mass production in the early 20th century.The forested mine site at Kisanfu was just one of two major purchases in recent years by China Molybdenum. The first came in 2016, when it took control of Tenke Fungurume, a mine that on its own produces twice as much cobalt as any other country in the world. At least $1.59 billion of the $2.65 billion Tenke Fungurume price tag, financial records show, came from loans provided by Chinese state-owned banks.Players in the clean energy revolution are increasingly caught in a cycle of exploitation and greed over resources. At the center of it is the quest\\xa0for a prized metal: cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars.As the Chinese were stepping up their focus on green energy in 2016, the soon-to-be U.S. president, Donald J. Trump, was extolling the fossil fuel industry, campaigning in West Virginia with a hard hat and shovel and falsely promising coal miners that “you’re going to be working your asses off!” After taking office, Mr. Trump would roll back requirements on American automakers intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, giving the Chinese an even wider lane.“It is pretty heartbreaking what happened here,” said Nicole Widdersheim, who worked on Africa issues for the National Security Council during the Trump administration. “Just so stupid.”The frenzy for Congo’s cobalt has attracted an international cast of opportunists, luminaries and shadowy characters eager to benefit. At one point, it also drew in a Chinese-based private equity firm that Hunter Biden helped found and that was later scrutinized in the 2020 presidential campaign.At the same time, Chinese companies are running into new headwinds from Congo’s government, according to documents obtained by The Times and interviews with current and former senior U.S. officials.Congolese officials are carrying out a broad review of past mining contracts, work they are doing with financial help from the American government as part of its broader anti-corruption effort. They are examining whether companies are fulfilling their contractual obligations, including a 2008 commitment from China to deliver billions of dollars’ worth of new roads, bridges, power plants and other infrastructure.Congo’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, in August named a commission to investigate allegations that China Molybdenum, the company that bought the two Freeport-McMoRan properties, might have cheated the Congolese government out of billions of dollars in royalty payments. The company risks being expelled from Congo.At the Tenke Fungurume mine, there have long been problems associated with trespassers from nearby villages scavenging for cobalt. After China Molybdenum called on the government to help, Congolese troops fired on a trespasser inside the mine’s gates, killing him, as well as a second person who was shot after riots broke out in protest, witnesses and local officials told The Times.Separately, at least a dozen employees or contractors at the mine told The Times that Chinese ownership had led to a drastic decline in safety and an increase in injuries, many of which were not reported to management. Two Congolese safety officers said workers were assaulted after they raised concerns and were offered bribes to cover up accidents.“Things are falling apart in terms of safety,” said Alfred Kiloko Makeba, who retired last year after a decade working as a safety supervisor at the mine.Vincent Zhou, a spokesman for China Molybdenum, rejected claims that the company had cheated the Congolese government or relaxed safety standards, saying the opposite was true, and questioned if there was an organized effort to undermine the company.China has an idiom that goes something like: “Where there is a will to condemn, evidence will follow,” Mr. Zhou said in a written response to The Times. “Vaguely I feel that we may be caught in the gaming of greater powers.”African countries for years have been turning to China for help building infrastructure with loans or trades involving their natural resources — deals that analysts warn provide far more benefit to the Chinese.A blueprint for those deals, now common across the continent, was sketched out in 2005 when Joseph Kabila walked into the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Mr. Kabila, then just 33, was the new president of Congo after the assassination of his father, another tragic milepost on the poverty-stricken country’s road of violence and political disruption.China was familiar territory for Mr. Kabila, who had received military training there in the late 1990s. This visit was about enlisting the help of President Hu Jintao in turning around Congo’s economy.The United States, which had long provided economic and military assistance to Congo, was locked in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and had become increasingly uninterested in the country. Congo’s poor record on graft and human rights was also scaring away many international banks and Western investors.Mr. Kabila’s wish list was long: He wanted new roads, schools and hospitals as part of a revival plan that, he hoped, would endear him back home to a nation exhausted and dispirited by years of conflict and corruption.In exchange, he was prepared to offer up his country’s vast mineral wealth — unparalleled in much of the world.In the imposing hall on Tiananmen Square, the two presidents outlined a deal that would change Central Africa’s balance of power, according to André Kapanga, a former adviser to Mr. Kabila who offered details of the meeting for the first time in an interview with The Times.Mr. Hu explained that many people in China’s western provinces lived in deep poverty. Developing the area was a cornerstone of his domestic policy, and he needed minerals and metals to build out new industries. Congo was ready to help, Mr. Kabila assured him.China had already acquired raw materials from Congo’s neighbor, Angola, where it offered generous financial support in exchange for oil.But this potential deal with Mr. Kabila was more ambitious than any other, and a diplomatic drama would play out at the riverside Palais de la Nation in the capital of Kinshasa before it was sealed.The setting was Mr. Kabila’s inauguration in 2006, after he stood before voters in a formal election and won the presidency. The Bush administration sent a delegation led by Elaine Chao, then the secretary of labor.Mr. Kabila liked motorcycles, and she presented him with a Harley-Davidson trinket when she greeted him at a lunch. That would be the extent of their interaction, Ms. Chao believed, but members of her delegation urged her to ask for a private meeting, according to Laura Genero, an associate deputy labor secretary who was on the trip. To her surprise, Mr. Kabila complied with a meeting the next day.Ms. Chao was so unprepared for the invitation that she had to borrow a beige pantsuit from Ms. Genero. She had packed just one work outfit.The U.S. delegation congratulated Mr. Kabila on his democratic victory and listened as he talked about wanting to expand access to electricity across the nation. One of his aides characterized the meeting as mostly small talk.But a similar meeting between the new president and Chinese officials played out differently, according to Mr. Kapanga, who was briefed on both the U.S. and Chinese discussions.The Chinese used the opportunity to begin formal talks with Mr. Kabila that would result in a $6 billion agreement: China would pay for roads, hospitals, rail lines, schools and projects to expand electricity, all in exchange for access to 10 million tons of copper and more than 600,000 tons of cobalt.The local media called it the “the deal of the century,” and while Mr. Kabila celebrated the agreement, the global financial community reacted more warily, worried Congo was taking on too much debt.American officials marveled at the deal’s historic scale. In secret cables made public by WikiLeaks, they noted that previous Chinese investment in Congo had been “an informal, somewhat disorganized collection of Chinese businesses” that did not seriously threaten U.S. interests.Now something much grander was in the making: “2,000 miles of roadway linking Orientale and Katanga provinces, 31 hospitals, 145 health centers, two large universities and 5,000 government housing units are pledged,” according to a cable in 2008 from the U.S. embassy in Kinshasa to members of the Central Intelligence Agency, the secretary of state and other officials.“And that’s not all,” the cable continued.By 2015, China’s presence in Congo had become visible in numerous infrastructure projects: Soccer stadiums rose from the dust, roadways were expanded, work began on water treatment facilities.But not all of its progress in cornering the cobalt market could be measured in brick and mortar. The Chinese ambassador at the time, Wang Tongqing, kicked off an American-style diplomatic blitz.Mr. Wang threw out the jump ball that year at a Chinese corporate basketball tournament that drew Congolese spectators.He gave out scholarships to Congolese students to study in China and was on hand when a Chinese organization donated plane tickets for a Congolese choir to tour his country. At one point, he offered $1 million for Ebola relief in Congo.Mr. Wang’s activities coincided with the 2015 rollout of his country’s “Made in China 2025” policy, which detailed China’s plan to transform itself into a “manufacturing superpower” in 10 areas, including batteries for electric vehicles.Almost instantly a tidal wave of government-backed capital poured into Chinese companies in Congo and elsewhere. Deals quickly followed.That year, the state-owned China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group said it would partner with Congo’s state mining company, Gécamines, to develop the Deziwa site, then one of the largest copper and cobalt concessions in the country.In 2017, Zijin Mining, a Chinese state-backed company with a slogan of “Harmony Begets Wealth,” raised almost $700 million from a sale of private shares to develop its Kolwezi mine.Public statements about the deals signaled some of China’s ambition, but the history and scale of the effort have not been previously reported.Corporate filings, including annual reports and bond prospectuses, examined by The Times show that the five biggest Chinese companies in Congo had been given at least $124 billion in credit lines for their global operations. All of the companies are state-owned or have significant minority stakes held by various levels of the Chinese government.“Unlike the U.S., the Chinese government is always behind Chinese investors in Africa and more specifically in D.R.C.,” said Mr. Kapanga, the former adviser to Mr. Kabila.The biggest deal came in April 2016, when China Molybdenum, a company whose biggest shareholders are a government-owned company and a reclusive billionaire, made its $2.65 billion offer to buy Tenke Fungurume, an American-owned mine atop one of the biggest cobalt reserves in the world.There was one complication. Freeport-McMoRan had a Canadian partner that had the right of first offer to buy its stake. China Molybdenum’s solution was to have a Shanghai-based private equity firm buy out the partner, but even that deal relied on money from the Chinese government.None of the $1.14 billion raised to buy the partner’s share came from private investors, company filings show. Instead, it came from Chinese state-controlled entities, including from bank loans guaranteed by China Molybdenum as well as cash brought to the deal through obscure shell companies controlled by government-owned banks, according to the filings.The board of the private equity firm, commonly known as BHR, was dominated by Chinese members but also included three Americans: Devon Archer, a businessman who later was convicted of defrauding the Oglala Sioux tribe in a case still working through the legal system, and James Bulger, son of the former president of the Massachusetts State Senate.Another was Hunter Biden, whose father was vice president at the time.It is not clear if Mr. Biden, who had helped found the firm in 2013, was involved in the deal. Mr. Biden did not respond to requests for comment. A former member of the BHR board, who was not authorized to speak about internal business matters, said that none of the Americans had played a role and that the fees generated for the work had not been distributed to Mr. Biden or others. A spokesman for President Biden on Friday said he had not been made aware of his son’s connection to the sale.How and why the firm had become involved was a mystery to the chief executive who negotiated the sale for Freeport-McMoRan’s Canadian-based partner, Lundin Mining.“Were they a partner, their adviser or a financier? I don’t know,” said Paul Conibear, then Lundin’s chief executive.An elaborate event under white tents in Kinshasa celebrated China’s new ownership in May 2017. Mr. Wang was there along with Chinese officials who had helped finance the purchase — and a host of Chinese government-affiliated bankers looking to make even more mining deals.Within a few years, they would help orchestrate China Molybdenum’s purchase of Kisanfu, the huge untapped cobalt reserve, from the same American mining giant. Together the sales marked a changing of the guard in Congo as the United States abandoned its mining interests — a problem that now weighs on President Biden as he and his aides have come to realize the extent of China’s dominance in clean energy.“The D.R.C. has a vast territory, rich natural resources and great investment potential,” Mr. Wang told the crowd. “A Chinese proverb says, ‘Build a beautiful nest to attract the phoenix.’”At first, the changes seemed almost trivial at Tenke Fungurume — a 24-hour operation that employs more than 7,000 across a landscape the size of Los Angeles marked by deep craters and dust kicked up by earth-moving vehicles.The new Chinese managers showed up in shorts and sneakers, a shock to employees who had been required to wear steel-toed boots and safety goggles.“We were like, ‘Oh, this is not possible,’” said Pierrot Kitobo Sambisaya, who worked as a metallurgist at the mine for a decade until 2019 and had grown accustomed to a stricter environment.Soon, work anniversaries came and went with no recognition. Holiday parties where workers’ families were invited to tour the mine no longer took place. Dozens of janitor and driver jobs once held by Congolese citizens went to the Chinese.That was just the start. Employees were concerned that the mine was also becoming more dangerous, according to interviews with workers in communities surrounding the mine, current and former safety inspectors, Congolese government officials and mining executives.Workers climbed into acid tanks to conduct repairs without checking the air quality. Others drove bulldozers and other heavy equipment without training or did dangerous welding jobs without proper oversight.Last year, a worker was sitting in his truck while it was being towed, and it flipped. The worker tried to jump to safety, but the truck landed on him and crushed him to death, according to an annual operations report from China Molybdenum.All of it was an extreme departure from the company’s American predecessor, which had “zero tolerance” for risky activities and safety violations, according to Alfred Kiloko Makeba, the veteran safety supervisor, and 10 other current and former employees, managers and contractors.Freeport-McMoRan, which had built the mine, had learned some hard lessons years before at its copper and gold mine in Indonesia, facing international protest over its dumping toxic mine waste into a river in the rainforest as well as violent conflicts over its operations there.In Congo, the company had its own struggles as it moved to build Tenke Fungurume, displacing more than 1,500 residents in a haphazard process. But once the mine opened, it gained an unusual amount of respect for its commitment to worker safety, both among local officials and U.S. diplomats.Worker safety is an issue at other industrial mines in Congo, but under Freeport, employees who violated rules were immediately disciplined or fired, safety officers said. Records examined by The Times show just one reported death among workers during the eight years Freeport-McMoRan ran the mine, although it repeatedly published accounts of near-fatal accidents as cautionary guides.When safety inspectors discovered violations after China Molybdenum took over, they were sometimes told to overlook them, or offered bribes to do so, workers and supervisors said. And when they did try to enforce the rules, violence sometimes followed.One safety officer said he was thrown to the ground by a worker he had called out for improperly using welding equipment. The man twisted his arm and broke his cellphone and work-issue camera.An executive at Gécamines, the Congolese agency that is a minority shareholder in the mine, said employees had reported confrontations and safety problems to the agency’s board. Safety issues are now part of a broader review of China Molybdenum’s operations.Mr. Zhou, the China Molybdenum spokesman, denied that any inspectors had been assaulted. The allegations, he suggested, were probably being fabricated by fired employees.In a statement to The Times, he said the mine had “a robust occupational health and safety framework in place and continues to exercise its zero tolerance rules.” In fact, he said, “internal statistics” published in a company report this year showed that worker injuries had declined since the company took over.But employees who said they had been repeatedly told not to report injuries believed the data was being fixed as part of a campaign to cover up rising hazards.That suggestion, which The Times was not able to independently confirm and which China Molybdenum disputed, was crystallized for Mr. Makeba one evening last year when he received an urgent phone call. A worker at the mine had fallen from a high perch after not wearing the required safety harness, he said.Mr. Makeba rushed to the site and was shocked to learn, he said, that the worker, who had broken his leg, had been taken to a private clinic instead of the mine’s.Mr. Makeba said the employee told him that his supervisors had paid him to keep quiet so that it would not be reported to management, where it would show up on the company’s audited injury tally.When Mr. Makeba alerted his own boss, he said, he was told to drop the matter.Mr. Zhou rejected Mr. Makeba’s account, adding that “any form of cover-up in disclosures is against rules, and corporate values.”But according to Mr. Makeba and another safety manager still working at the mine, labor conditions have become increasingly important to automakers sensitive to consumer and shareholder demands. So China Molybdenum, they said, has blocked them from reporting near fatalities and routinely ignored other injuries.“Safety is just on paper now,” Mr. Makeba said.Problems at Tenke Fungurume are not just limited to employees’ complaints inside the mine.Freeport-McMoRan had struggled with trespassers who carted off bags of cobalt. Some even died when hand-dug tunnels flooded or collapsed.With China Molybdenum in charge, the conflict became much worse.The company, faced with thousands of newly arriving trespassers, asked the government to send soldiers to help control the situation, one executive who worked at the mine back then told The Times.The military arrived and began patrolling Tenke Fungurume and other local mines, bulldozing depots where trespassers were selling their cobalt rocks to traders.The troops remained for months, and the situation eventually turned deadly. A soldier at Tenke Fungurume opened fire, killing an unauthorized digger, according to an employee who told The Times he had witnessed the encounter.Riots then erupted in the man’s home village when friends arrived carrying his body. In the melee, a protester was shot dead, according to three local officials and the mine employee.China Molybdenum paid for the burials, they said.Troops with AK-47s were posted outside the mine this year, along with security guards hired from a company founded by Erik Prince, the former Navy SEAL turned private security consultant.Even as this crackdown on theft was underway, the new managers at the mine were looking for ways to cut costs while increasing production.China Molybdenum said it had saved more than $130 million a year through its “cost and efficiency” programs. “New management revitalizes the business by bringing ‘Chinese efficiency and Chinese elements,’” the company boasts on its website.China Molybdenum is steadily growing its output. Last December, it snatched up Kisanfu, paying Freeport-McMoRan $550 million for what is considered one of the world’s largest untapped supplies of cobalt. The ground underneath the site contains enough cobalt, according to China Molybdenum’s estimates, to power hundreds of millions of long-range Teslas.And then in August, China Molybdenum announced plans to spend $2.5 billion at Tenke Fungurume to double production over the next two years. When the expansion is complete, the mine will produce nearly 40,000 tons a year. Last year, the United States produced just 600 tons.This rush to expand, however, has drawn scrutiny from top government officials in Congo, reaching all the way to Mr. Tshisekedi, the president.Questions have surfaced over payments Tenke Fungurume’s operators may owe to Congo, dating back to when the American company controlled the mine. When new deposits are confirmed at Tenke Fungurume, the owners are required to notify Gécamines, the Congolese agency, and pay $12 for every additional ton.The accusations have provoked a bitter dispute between Congolese officials and the mine managers, with China Molybdenum’s spokesman calling the allegations “unbelievable, wrong calculations” based on an accounting error.Gécamines executives have discussed forcing out the management at Tenke Fungurume or even taking the mine out of China Molybdenum’s control, according to two Congolese mining executives involved in confidential discussions as well as a government official briefed on the talks.Robert North, a New Mexico-based geologist who has helped prepare reserve estimates at the mine for Freeport and China Molybdenum, said both companies as well as Gécamines knew of large amounts of cobalt underground at the site. China Molybdenum has been cautious in declaring it, he said, until the company knows it wants to go to the expense of extracting the deeper layers.Mr. Tshisekedi’s commission is still investigating the allegations, and the president himself recently presided over a tense, six-hour meeting with top company executives.Separately, the Congolese government, with financial assistance from the United States, is examining numerous mining contracts to determine whether Congo has been shortchanged more broadly. While the Chinese-funded infrastructure projects got off to a flashy start, many have not been built, officials said.During a visit to the cobalt-mining region this year, the president acknowledged that corrupt or incompetent government officials in Congo might deserve some blame for deals that have left the nation feeling shortchanged.“Some of our compatriots had badly negotiated the mining contracts,” he said. “I’m very harsh on these investors who come to enrich themselves alone. They come with empty pockets and leave as billionaires.”Chinese government officials insist that the relationship is still on track and that the benefits to Congo are substantial.The countries have a “longstanding friendship, and the bilateral practical cooperation has yielded fruitful win-win results and enjoys broad prospects,” Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a news conference in September.In an interview in Kinshasa, Mr. Tshisekedi said that his focus was not on which foreign power would dominate mining in Congo, but rather on how his country could share in the wealth generated by the clean energy revolution.“We have an amazing potential for renewable energy, be it through our strategic metals or through our rivers,” he said, referring to both mining and hydroelectric power. “Our idea is, how can we put this amazing resource at the disposal of the world, but while making sure that it first benefits Congolese and it benefits Africans?”Dionne Searcey reported from Kisanfu, Michael Forsythe from New York and Eric Lipton from Washington.

The president’s chief of staff, Vital Kamerhe, was convicted on corruption charges; violent conflicts have increased in the eastern DRC; civil society has mounted increasing anti-corruption campaigns; and a major political reconfiguration is currently underway that may significantly change the shape of reforms. Meanwhile, in a bipartisan letter, the U.S. Senate highlighted the need for urgent anti-corruption and electoral reforms in the country and the International Monetary Fund is considering a significant loan to stabilize the country’s economy, pending anti-corruption reforms.On Friday, Dec. 18, the Foreign Policy program at Brookings hosted a panel discussion examining the issues and the possible U.S. policy options to address them.Viewers submitted questions via email to events@brookings.edu or on Twitter using #DRCSecurity.',\n",

But the 22-year-old, dressed in a blue workman’s uniform and accompanied by a team of prospectors, was performing a critical first step in an emerging high-tech quest to find the metals key to powering a clean energy future.After a day collecting bags of soil, Eshiloni and his colleagues would haul their samples to a makeshift camp, where they are dried, sieved, and tested for traces of 34 chemical elements. Even tiny amounts offer clues whether ores containing copper and cobalt, both critical to the production of electric vehicles, lie below.(The electric travel revolution has arrived. Read about it here.)These first steps aren’t so different from the way mining companies have explored since the mid 20th century. But what happens next amounts to a high-stakes test of new data-driven techniques that some believe could radically transform mining—and help limit global warming in the process.Unlike conventional prospectors, this team from KoBold Metals, a Bill Gates-backed California start-up, is using the data that they assemble—from soil samples to airborne surveys to reams of historical documents—as building blocks for a suite of complex geological models that are powered by artificial intelligence. KoBold and its backers are betting that AI will more effectively predict where ores have formed, and ultimately unlock new, deeper deposits.KoBold isn’t the only mining company that’s embracing big data to aid the next generation of discoveries. But its high-profile financiers and focus on the metals needed for the green energy revolution are drawing attention to an emerging raw materials bottleneck that risks thwarting global efforts, including deals negotiated at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Scotland, to build a less carbon-intensive world.According to the International Energy Agency, keeping global warming “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the central goal of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, will require unprecedented growth in the production of commodities like copper, cobalt, nickel, and lithium. All are essential building blocks for solar panels, wind turbines, power lines and, above all, battery-powered electric vehicles, which are less carbon intensive than their gas-fueled counterparts, especially where electricity is generated from renewables.By 2040, the IEA projects that meeting Paris targets will require annual global sales of more than 70 million electric cars and trucks, which together will demand as much as 30 times the quantity of metals that’s used in their production now.Shifting to a green future is not without contradictory complications—at least for the immediate future. Although new technologies and tighter regulations have made mining less environmentally destructive, the extraction and processing of metals still contaminates water and soil, encroaches on habitats, and emits pollutants and the same greenhouse gases that have caused a warming climate to begin with.Emissions linked to the minerals used in green energy technologies, however, are a small fraction of those generated by the fossil fuel-powered systems they’re designed to replace. Over time, as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates, more battery recycling could make the search for new battery metals less imperative. Some of the green transportation burden could be shouldered by other solutions still in development—such as cars fueled by hydrogen—or technologies not yet imagined.For now, though, analysts stress there’s no substitute for digging rocks out of the Earth.Keeping warming to below 2 degrees Celsius using existing technologies will require “massive additional volumes of metals,” says Julian Kettle, senior vice president of mining and metals at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy consultancy. “There’s simply no way around that.”Founded in 2018, KoBold derives its name from cobalt, a lustrous bluish-silver metal that helps drive performance of the lithium-ion batteries that revolutionized consumer electronics when they were introduced in the early 1990s. The same batteries are used on a much larger scale to power electric vehicles, and cobalt gives them greater range, longer lifespans, and better protection against fires by reducing corrosion.Its supply, though, is especially precarious: Nearly 70 percent is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a history of labor abuses and corruption have heightened the urgency to find deposits elsewhere. Automakers are also seeking cobalt alternatives—the metal, after all, is an expensive commodity—though the performance limitations of today’s cobalt-free batteries makes cobalt demand likely to accelerate. \\xa0Other metals KoBold seeks to unearth could soon feel a supply crunch as well. Gerbrand Ceder, a materials scientist who researches batteries at the University of California, Berkeley, believes nickel faces the greatest risk of long-term shortages, in part because it’s the most viable cobalt substitute.Analysts also foresee a scarcity of copper, which is used in a range of green technologies, including electric vehicle motors, wiring, and charging infrastructure. A typical battery powered automobile uses three times as much copper as its gas-guzzling cousins.These supply constraints have emerged, in part, because discovering viable metal deposits has become harder. That’s largely because the most accessible ones have been extracted: In Zambia, Africa’s second largest producer of copper, the ores mined today were either “sticking out of the ground” or just below the surface when they were found, according to David Broughton, a geologist with 25 years’ experience in the region who advises KoBold and others.This doesn’t mean there aren’t deposits lurking deeper in the earth: The interaction between rocks and fluids that formed them more than 400 million years ago occurred well beneath the surface. But unlike the oil and gas industry, which has gotten markedly better at accessing hard-to-reach places, mining exploration has not made a major technological leap in decades. As a result, odds of success are dismal. By most industry estimates, fewer than one percent of projects in areas without extensive prior exploration result in commercially viable deposits.KoBold’s goal is to “reduce the uncertainty of what’s under the surface,” says Josh Goldman, the company’s chief technology officer. A more rigorous application of data and a boost from the evolving field of artificial intelligence are key to improving those odds.Techniques of AI, including automation and machine learning, have already aided the climate fight by enabling better tracking of emissions, more sophisticated climate modeling, and the development of smart grids and other energy-saving devices. AI applications in mining have primarily focused on improving extraction from existing operations, though there’s gathering momentum in using them to aid the search for new deposits.Today, companies ranging from tech behemoths like IBM to more specialized outfits like Canada’s Minerva and GoldSpot offer AI tools or services geared toward exploration. KoBold, though, is one of the few that also invests its own capital in projects—including its efforts in Zambia and others in Canada, Greenland, and Western Australia.The company’s technological wizardry consists of two complementary systems. Connie Chan, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which invested in KoBold in 2019 along with Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, likens the first to a “Google Maps for the Earth’s crust and below.”Building it is a geological treasure hunt. Not only does KoBold collect its own data—drawn from rock and soil sampling, and measurements like gravity and magnetism taken from a helicopter. It also scours the historical record, using tools of machine learning—where computers draw insights from data too complex for humans—to extract key information from old maps and geological reports, which can run into the millions of pages. On some projects, KoBold forms joint ventures with established mining companies, which provide data of their own. BHP, the world’s most valuable mining firm, is a partner in Australia.KoBold uses all this information to build and train a suite of analytical tools it calls “machine prospector.” While they won’t unearth metals directly, they can give geologists a better idea of where to look—or where not to. One tool key to KoBold’s work in Zambia helps identify mafic rock—which can fool explorers into thinking they’ve found copper—and therefore prevent costly failed drilling.Another tool, in use in northern Quebec, where KoBold hopes to find nickel, copper, and cobalt, guides its research team to the most promising rock outcroppings for sampling, hastening the search. “You can actually get through an area of a couple hundred square kilometers in a season,” says David Freedman, a KoBold geologist who spent last summer traversing the tundra.Machine learning tools developed by KoBold and others have already made geologists’ lives easier; as Freedman notes, there’s no wind, rain, or mosquitos when planning out a prospecting route from behind a computer. Nonetheless, these techniques are still in their early stages and their ability to drive major finds remains an open question.Antoine Caté, a geologist and data scientist at SRK, an international consultancy, believes machine learning models have the potential to “dramatically improve” success rates in \\xa0exploration—in part due to their ability to detect patterns among datasets with more variables than the human brain can process. Still, he cautions such tools are only as good as the information that’s fed into them: If an algorithm is built with substandard data, it will be ineffective at best and at worst lead prospectors down false paths.AI also doesn’t eliminate the need for human ingenuity. “These tools are amazing for diagnostics,” Caté says. “But at the end of the day you still need a skilled person to take the information and make something out of it.”KoBold’s Goldman agrees. The need for robust data, he says, is why KoBold’s sleuthing is so meticulous. Still, he admits the company’s tech could take time to fulfill its promise, and how much it might speed up discoveries of deposits is uncertain.Chan, whose firm has helped fund tech giants like Airbnb and Instagram, believes the wait will be worth it. The mining industry’s exploration struggles and the urgency to find more battery metals, she says, means a software-driven approach is long overdue. “If anyone can show they’re more effective at choosing the right places to look—that’s incredibly valuable.”Even if machine learning techniques prove successful, though, it might not be enough to prevent future shortages. Better exploration is only part of the picture: To meet the Paris Agreement’s two-degree goal, Wood Mackenzie estimates that the mining industry will need to invest more than $2 trillion in mine development over the next 15 years—a colossal increase from the roughly $500 billion it committed in the 15 years prior. Scaling up will also require action from governments. Too often, Kettle says, policymakers stimulate demand for green technologies while also enacting regulations that make it harder to mine the materials needed to power them.In Zambia, embracing the green energy revolution is a national matter. A new government elected in August is seeking to turn around an economy ravaged by debt, and minerals, which account for three-quarters of exports, are essential to that puzzle. Minister of Mines Paul Chanda Kabuswe says the “looming boom” in battery metals has the potential to bring Zambia “immense benefits.” Still, no major deposits have been discovered in decades. To secure supply for the long run, the mining industry will need to do better.Humphrey Mbasela, a Zambian geologist helping KoBold make sense of the soil in Mushindamo District, believes the big data approach will help. For too long, he says, explorers have been “chicken scratching”—too focused on searching near the surface, while the big prizes lie deeper.“The resources are there, undercover,” he says after a day trudging through woods and fields gathering samples. “They’ve just not been unraveled.”Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2021 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

The task force seized 2,067 pounds of ivory and 75 pounds of pangolin scales worth approximately $3.5 million. Congolese law enforcement and Embassy officials then worked together to secure appropriate storage at the Central Bank for the seized items.\\xa0This operation was conducted in the context of the U.S.-DRC Privileged Partnership for Peace, Prosperity and Preservation of the environment, through which both countries work together to promote effective governance, improve the rule of law, fight corruption and combat crime. As it pertains to this case, the United States Government, particularly working through the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, is assisting the DRC protect its natural resources for the benefit of the Congolese people and humanity.\\xa0“I applaud the determined action of our U.S.-DRC task force. This successful operation exemplifies the United States government’s concrete commitment to collaborate with Congolese law enforcement to combat illicit wildlife trafficking that robs the DRC of its natural treasures and also serves to finance armed groups and terrorists,” said Ambassador Mike Hammer. “We will continue to work together to thwart these nefarious actors and protect the Democratic Republic of Congo’s biodiversity.”\\xa0The United States supports President Felix Tshisekedi and the Congolese government’s stated priority to end corruption and impunity. \\xa0To advance this common cause and continue to reduce the trafficking of wildlife products in the DRC and support global conservation efforts, the United States will continue to partner to increase the capacity of the DRC’s criminal justice system to investigate, arrest, and convict traffickers. This joint Congolese-U.S. operation is a big win that serves notice on those involved in wildlife trafficking or related illicit economic activities.\\xa0By U.S. Embassy Kinshasa | 8 November, 2021 | Topics: News, Press Releases | Tags: Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, cooperation, Fight against corruption, security issues, Trade, trafficking, U.S.-D.R.C partenrship, wildlife traffickingFooter Disclaimer This is the official website of the U.S. Embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

       " 'By Sasha Lezhnev and Sarah GardinerIn the wake of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (hereafter Congo) flawed December 2018 elections, it is important for the international community to focus on key areas that can have a lasting impact in the country, in particular on addressing high-level corruption. Corruption is at the core of a particular type of systemic corruption in Congo – a form of state capture – that incentivizes certain elites inside and outside the country to derive personal profit via illicit financial activity while undermining government institutions and the rule of law in the deeply impoverished country. Human rights abuses are also endemic to this system.Concerns extend far beyond vote rigging and lack of transparency during the vote tabulation process, with leaked results from Congo’s electoral commission and results compiled by the Catholic Church election observation mission showing that opposition coalition candidate Martin Fayulu had won by a landslide and not the candidate ultimately declared victorious, Félix Tshisekedi. Ultimately, this election rigging occurred in order to perpetuate a status quo of systemic corruption and violence. Achieving progress in other key areas hinges on meaningfully addressing grand corruption in Congo, or reform measures will be blocked by elites with a vested interest in perpetuating systemic state capture. Unless there is a major impact on grand corruption, endemic armed conflict – perpetuated in large part by corrupt elements in the Congolese army – will continue largely unabated alongside other human rights abuses and poverty. Moreover, efforts to improve Congo’s investment climate as well as implement much-needed judicial, security sector, and other governance reforms will falter.Despite the way in which the new government came to power, bolstered by a new parliamentary majority held by ex-president Joseph Kabila’s political coalition, Congo’s current political transition offers some new opportunities to begin to enact critical transparency and accountability reforms. The fact that the election was both largely peaceful and transferred power to an opposition candidate, albeit one far more closely aligned with Kabila than Fayulu, indicates that there is some window for reform.This moment of opportunity requires a two-track approach: engaging with the new administration in support of anti-corruption, transparency and accountability reforms on the one hand; and more aggressive financial pressure targeted toward the heart of the system of violent kleptocracy. The latter will provide the new government the political space it needs to enact key reforms.The United States, European Union, and African Union can play key roles in combating corruption by leveraging Congolese reform efforts to transform Congo’s deeply embedded kleptocratic system. While closely engaging with Congolese civil society and the government on good governance, transparency, security and anti-corruption reforms, these actors should make strategic use of financial pressure against high-profile corrupt actors. Recent US sanctions against three senior electoral commission officials are an important step to hold accountable those responsible for election fraud. However, much more significant financial pressure is needed on political leaders and their commercial partners inside and outside Congo in order to have a real impact leading to desperately needed transparency and good governance reforms. These actors have profited personally from a corrupt system that enables violence while the majority of the country has suffered from poor health services, education and infrastructure, as well as security services that are frequently predatory on the civilian population. The use of financial pressure tools will be key to undermining the influence of former president Joseph Kabila and his inner circle, who were involved in extensive corruption during their time in office and yet continue to wield significant – perhaps even preponderant – influence in the new government, including in the military, the parliament, the judiciary, and the executive.Anti-corruption reforms in Congo will only succeed if they are strongly supported by Congolese civil society and backed by international financial pressure, particularly through targeted network sanctions and anti-money laundering measures. The United States has a unique ability to exert financial pressure on corrupt actors because of Congo’s reliance on US dollar transactions, which are overwhelmingly cleared by US banks and other financial institutions. The European Union, individual European governments and the African Union also have critical roles to play, as corrupt officials frequently travel to and own properties and bank accounts in Europe and elsewhere in Africa.Through this two-pronged approach, the United States, European Union and African Union can help create political space to allow President Tshisekedi to follow through on reforms to transform Congo’s corrupt system into a more democratic, transparent state. Targeted network sanctions and anti-money laundering measures against officials, their companies and networks of associates involved in corruption would marginalize them from positions of power and therefore lessen their influence in the new government. For example, it will be difficult for Tshisekedi to name officials under sanctions as ministers for fear of sparking further sanctions and anti-money laundering measures. Similarly, financial measures targeting corrupt business deals over state contracts could also pressure the Tshisekedi government to investigate and potentially re-negotiate these deals.',\n",

The event fulfils a campaign promise made by then-candidate Biden to organize a summit of democracies during his first year in office.The gathering has been dismissed in some quarters as a hollow performative exercise, rendered meaningless by the inevitable controversy over\\xa0the guest list. But arguments about the substance of the summit, as well as which countries were invited and which were snubbed, sidestep a crucial point: The importance of the exercise lies precisely in its symbolism. If Washington is able to persuade more than 100 countries to make a public declaration of their commitment to democracy in a choreographed event, it won’t magically change the world into a utopia. But it could potentially put pressure on the countries that attend the gathering to uphold the democratic pledges they made there. More importantly, the summit could give momentum to those Americans preoccupied with the worsening crisis of democracy in the United States. ...enter your email address then choose one of the three options below.Subscribe to World Politics Review and you'll receive instant access to 10,000+ articles in the World Politics Review Library, along with new\",\n",

The August election of Zambia\\'s President Hakainde Hichilema, which he won by a landslide, was widely hailed as a milestone for African opposition movements.But while in his first 100 days in office Hichilema had reassured investors, he has been seen to drag his feet on promises to fight corruption and reduce poverty, fuelling impatience among voters.Zambians turned out en masse to vote for change on August 12, fed up with growing economic hardship and repression under their former leader Edgar Lungu.Hichilema inherited a heavily indebted country -- the first in Africa to default during Covid -- and soured bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Sworn in on August 24, he vowed to revive the economy, root out graft and woo back scarred investors to Africa\\'s second copper producer.Much of the international community remains starry-eyed, but some Zambians are beginning to feel disenchanted.\"The president is too slow,\" said Martin Nawa, a 30-year-old newspaper vendor in the capital Lusaka.\"These people are hiding whatever they have stolen,\" he told AFP, referring to alleged embezzlement by the previous regime.Critics say Hichilema has been slow to take action against wrongdoers.So far, only one former state journalist has been charged for acquiring property with public funds. She was freed after surrendering her assets.\"He has only shown the will to fight corruption, but he will not achieve anything with the same officials in the police\" and anti-graft bodies, said Zambian rights activist Brebner Changala.A self-made businessman, Hichilema centred his campaign on economic restructuring.The 2022 budget he presented to parliament at the end of October was well-received among investors and creditors -- reassured by promised fiscal reforms, spending cuts and debt transparency.These measures \"will help the country make progress in debt restructuring\" and facilitate negotiations with the IMF that resumed this month, said Aleix Montana of risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft.Hichilema has been critical in international media of the billions of dollars of sovereign debt Lungu accumulated during his six-year rule.He claims it was grossly underestimated, particularly regarding money owed to China.The president \"is quite popular among investors, especially in the mining sector,\" said Montana, pointing to a new policy that will allow companies to deduct mineral royalties from corporate tax.Zambia\\'s sovereign bond prices, which jumped after Hichilema\\'s election, have continued to increase steadily, he added.Hichilema has sought to shelter citizens from the impact of fiscal reforms, increasing constituency development funds and introducing free access to secondary school.He also removed bribe-taking political cadres who controlled markets and bus stations under Lungu.But a \"proposed reduction of subsidies for fertiliser, electricity and fuel is likely to have a serious knock-on effect on people\\'s budgets,\" noted South Africa-based political analyst Nicole Beardsworth.Inflation has remained stuck at a high of over 20 percent, she added, stressing that it was still too early to draw a line.For his part, the more optimistic Zambian economist Maambo Hamaundu said: \"I can confidently say that as a country we are on the right trajectory/\"Politically, Hichilema set off on a positive note, freezing the bank accounts of Lungu\\'s close aides and filling government positions with technocrats.And even critics agree the new government is less repressive.\"What 100 days has done to us is give us back our freedom and liberty, and for that we must give him credit,\" Changala said.\\xa0Beardsworth, however, flagged a \"mushrooming of appointments to State House\" which he derided as \"thank-you appointments\".Eyebrows have also been raised around a flurry of work trips Hichilema has already made.Since a first trumpeted visit to the United States for the UN General Assembly, he has travelled to Glasgow for COP26 and attended events in Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa.Lusaka resident Sean Tembo, who leads a small opposition party, described the new president as Zambia\\'s \"Vasco da Gama\", a reference to the 16th-century Portuguese explorer.\"I travelled with a lean delegation\" on a commercial flight, Hichilema has tweeted in his defence, distancing himself from Lungu\\'s controversial presidential jet.A government spokesman declined to comment on Hichilema\\'s first 100 days in office, saying an official statement would be issued on the topic.The high expectations spurred by Hichilema\\'s victory could be a \"double-edged sword\", Montana said.\"Discontent will grow if he is unable to provide some tangible results,\" he warned. \"The people who voted for him are expecting a real change soon.\"',\n",

The monitoring sites where they travel to collect data are located in remote places in Virunga National Park, a wildlife sanctuary that is also home to a patchwork of armed groups. Staff members have been shot and wounded while on duty.\"We could predict [eruptions] if we had funding and if we had security in Virunga,\" Honoré Ciraba, a senior scientist at the GVO, told The New Humanitarian earlier this month.GVO researchers say their problems need addressing before disaster strikes again: Mount Nyiragongo is considered dangerous because of its fast-flowing lava and its proximity to Goma, an eastern Congolese city of 1.5 million people. Previous eruptions in 1977 and 2002 claimed hundreds of lives on each occasion.The volcano also sits adjacent to Lake Kivu, a body of water between Congo and Rwanda that contains vast amounts of toxic gas. Scientists say the gas could suffocate lakeside residents - an event known as a limnic eruption - if disturbed by an earthquake or a volcanic event\"The population is still vulnerable to the volcanic risks posed by Mount Nyiragongo,\" said Abel Minani, a researcher at the GVO, which is a state institution that falls under Congo\\'s Ministry of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation.Founded in 1986, the GVO was in a bad state before the May eruption. The World Bank decided not to renew a $1.8 million programme amid corruption allegations at the observatory, leaving it unable to pay internet bills, even as its staff warned of increased volcanic activity.After the eruption - which temporarily displaced 450,000 people - Congo\\'s government began topping up the wages of GVO staff, according to Adalbert Muhindo, the observatory\\'s director. He hopes a new seismology laboratory will soon be built, and that an upcoming international volcanology conference will bring new partnerships and support to the observatory.But interviews with GVO researchers in the aftermath of the eruption indicate that funding problems persist. And few staff members expect the recent salary supplements to last given the government\\'s long-standing failure to properly fund the observatory. Officials at Congo\\'s scientific ministry did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.Residents displaced by the volcano are, meanwhile, struggling to rebuild their lives. Though some have received support since the eruption, relief groups generally consider the crisis a low priority compared to other issues affecting eastern Congo, where more than a million people have been displaced in 2021.Jean de Dieu Mbasa lost his home in May, and with it the money to send his son to school. For a few dollars, he shifts heavy stones on the now-cooled lava to mark where people\\'s houses once stood. He uses torn socks over his hands to protect them from the heat.\"We lost many things because there was no warning [that the volcano would erupt],\" he told The New Humanitarian.Risky work, poorly rewardedBased in an office overlooking a dusty football pitch in Goma, the GVO is responsible for researching Mount Nyiragongo as well as its sister volcano, Mount Nyamuragira, which has been especially active in recent days.It is a Herculean job: Equipment regularly gets looted, destroyed in lightning strikes, or tangled in tropical vegetation, while patchy internet and bumpy dirt roads create other headaches.Despite a lack of resources, the observatory predicted the 2002 Mount Nyiragongo eruption, which flattened around 15 percent of Goma and triggered a major humanitarian crisis - in part because local authorities didn\\'t heed the GVO\\'s warnings.International aid was provided for reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the 2002 disaster. And greater support was extended to the GVO in the form of new equipment and staff training, various UN programmes, and long-standing international scientific research partnerships.Still, international funding dwindled as the memory of what happened in 2002 receded among foreign donors. And recent corruption allegations at the observatory put off donors, according to UN officials in Congo and members of the GVO.Awareness of the danger posed by Mount Nyiragongo also waned over the years among Goma\\'s population. Some residents settled in villages just a few kilometres from the volcano, in areas identified as high-risk.Warning panels installed in Goma to alert residents to the fluctuating danger posed by the volcano were ignored, or in some cases used for local advertising, according to recent research.Since the May eruption, additional equipment has been sent to the observatory and monitoring measures have been stepped up, according to Muhindo, who travelled to Kinshasa, Congo\\'s capital, in recent months to lobby the government for more support.But the current funding from the government doesn\\'t cover the GVO\\'s full research needs, Célestin Kasereka Mahinda, the observatory\\'s scientific director, told The New Humanitarian during an interview in August at his office in Goma.Mahinda said machines and equipment need replacing, GVO staff members need training - some of them abroad - and more awareness-raising needs to be done for Goma\\'s population.In October, one researcher said the institute didn\\'t have enough funds to afford a drone to take high-resolution photos of the May eruption site, while in July staff said the observatory was struggling to raise money for a research trip to the volcano summit.Several GVO researchers who spoke to The New Humanitarian said they were earning as little as 40 dollars per month and have often paid out of their own pockets to travel large distances to collect data. Some have taken side jobs to make ends meet.The volcanologists have also faced health risks as a consequence of their work. Charles Balagizi, a GVO scientist, said he had not been able to replace the filters in his gas mask - given to him by the US Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) in 2019 - for the past two years. His lungs have suffered as a result, doctors told him recently.The researchers said their salaries don\\'t reflect the importance of their mission, nor the challenges they face when travelling to remote places - challenges The New Humanitarian saw first hand on field trips with the GVO in July and August.On one mission in July, researchers balanced on hardened lava rocks examining the width of new fissures that had cracked open in the earth in May. The trip took the team though Virunga National Park, on a road known for its ambush risk.The next month scientists drove down dirt roads outside of Goma to collect crucial seismic data, passing areas where carbon dioxide emitted by the volcano can suffocate children and animals. A dead bird lying on the ground was said to be the latest victim.The monitoring efforts require constant commitment, said Dario Tedesco, an Italian volcanologist who has dedicated his life to studying Mount Nyiragongo. \"You need to do it every day, every single hour of the day,\" he told The New Humanitarian.Funding cuts and corruption concernsVolcanologists argue that there was no clear precursor event that could have predicted the May eruption, even though signs of increased volcanic activity were present in the months before.Still, the World Bank\\'s decision not to renew a programme that ended in October 2020 left the GVO lacking money to do crucial field missions, said Ciraba, the senior scientist. After the internet was cut, the institute also lost access to real time data, he added.The internet was eventually restored in April thanks to a contribution from VDAP. But a seven-month gap left volcanologists missing crucial details about volcanic activity at Mount Nyiragongo.The World Bank decision came amid allegations of embezzlement at the GVO, though the Bank said it could not corroborate those claims. Instead, it said the decision was based on the institution\\'s \"weakness\" in implementing grants.In an emailed statement to The New Humanitarian, a World Bank spokesperson said that - on completion of the grant - the organisation had emphasised to the Congolese government the importance of giving the GVO resources to cover its operational costs.But the government appears not to have plugged the gap, while other donors failed to step forward, said Omar Aboud, who previously led the Goma operation of the UN\\'s peacekeeping mission in Congo, known by its French acronym MONUSCO.Despite joint advocacy efforts by MONUSCO and the GVO, Aboud said donors lacked funding \"for this kind of unexpected and unplanned support\" and were put off by the corruption allegations.Aboud and other MONUSCO officials said the mission provided support to the GVO both before and after the May eruption. This includes helicopter flights to Mount Nyiragongo and the facilitation of outreach efforts to donors and diplomats.But Aboud said further support to the GVO \"would be too technical and scientific for a peacekeeping mission... would require a very high budget that MONUSCO does not have, and would fall way beyond our mandate\".The GVO also receives support from a group of international scientific partner organisations. But funding for these projects is usually focused on scientific objectives rather than the long-term operating costs of the observatory.Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inboxBy submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.Almost finished...We need to confirm your email address.To complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just sent you.There was a problem processing your submission.

Fresh fractures have opened in the ground that \"could be gates for new lava flows reaching Goma\", said the GVO\\'s Balagizi.Balagizi said the danger of a limnic eruption will persist as long as there is an active rift that can generate earthquakes capable of destabilising Lake Kivu, and as long as there are active volcanoes that can produce eruptive vents within the lake or empty hot lava into its depths.The pockets of carbon dioxide emitted by the volcano - referred to as Mazuku, or evil wind - pose another hazard to human health, as do plumes of sulphur dioxide, which can cause acid rain and contaminate drinking water.While various initiatives seek to raise awareness of the risks associated with Mount Nyiragongo - teachers in Goma use board games to help students know what to do in an emergency, for example - GVO scientists say more needs to be done.\"People have to watch and listen to understand what the scientists are teaching,\" said Muhindo, the GVO director. \"They must also avoid building infrastructure in places where there are lava flows.\"Aboud, the former MONUSCO official, said risks will remain no matter how much funding is forthcoming. \"If volcanoes are unpredictable, and the lava could take... half an hour to reach the city, how much can money really help?\" he said, adding: \"The population [is] squeezed between the volcano and the lake, and there are very few escape routes.\"Muhindo, however, is optimistic that the threats posed by Mount Nyiragongo can be properly managed by the observatory - should it be appropriately funded. \"Everybody is paying attention to GVO [after the eruption],\" he said. \"Very soon, things will change.\"With local reporting and research from an individual whose name is being withheld due to security concerns.Read the original article on The New Humanitarian.AllAfrica publishes around 700 reports a day from more than 100 news organizations and over 500 other institutions and individuals, representing a diversity of positions on every topic.

       " 'The former Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of Congo Eteni Longondo was placed Friday under provisional arrest for alleged misappropriation of funds allocated to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, prison and government sources said.\"The former Minister of Public Health, Dr. Eteni Longondo, was questioned at length by the prosecutor at the Court of Cassation and placed under provisional arrest warrant this evening. I do not know if he is already in prison,\" a member of the government told AFP, requesting anonymity \"in the name of the separation of powers.\"Dr. Eteni has indeed arrived here at the Makala central prison on the basis of a provisional arrest warrant issued by the prosecutor\\'s office. We have installed him in pavilion 8,\" a prison official told AFP on condition of anonymity.The transfer to the prison took place in the early evening, according to several sources contacted by AFP. Mr. Eteni Longondo, Minister of Health from 2019 until last April, is accused of \"misappropriation of public funds allocated to the response\" against Covid-19, wrote on Twitter the Association for Access to Justice (ACAJ).In August 2020, the General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF) had suspected the former minister Longondo of having embezzled more than 7 million dollars intended for the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic in the DRC, whose management is characterized by \"the absence of supporting documents of expenses\" made.Mr. Longondo has always denied having embezzled this money, arguing that \"these documents were in the process of being verified by his services\" at the time of the audit. In November, he returned $721,900 to the public treasury, representing \"the overpayment\" and \"the difference on the decontamination of the People\\'s Palace\", the seat of parliament, as well as a \"double payment made by the Central Bank of Congo\".Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has made the fight against corruption one of the priorities of his term. Mr. Longondo is the first executive of the presidential party Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) to be arrested for embezzling public funds.The former chief of staff to the Congolese leader, Vital Kamerhe, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for embezzling more than $50 million to build prefabricated houses for the military and police.AFPThe U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is investigating alleged corruption in mining deals in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where foreign companies purportedly bribed officials up to US$360 million between 2006 and 2011.More than 70% of the world’s cobalt comes from the resource-rich central African country, but more than 73% of its people live below the international poverty line. (Photo: Fairphone, Flickr, License)U.K. investigators first referred the case to Swiss authorities in 2014, and again in 2019 on the back of related claims of money laundering. The March 30 Swiss Federal Criminal Court decision dismissing the appeal made by one of the companies in question, which reveals details about the case for the first time, was only recently made public.The judgment identifies an anonymous individual “C” as a primary target of the corruption investigation. Although the court has not confirmed the identity of “C”, news sources have linked “C” to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a powerful mining magnate who has been placed under sanctions by the U.S. State Department for “extensive public corruption.”\"Insofar as is known, this is apparently the largest sum of money any Israeli has ever been suspected of paying as graft,\" Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.Gertler has been described by the U.S. Treasury Department as having amassed his fortune through “hundreds of millions of dollars worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals.”Gertler’s friendship with former Congolese president Joseph Kabila allowed him to act as a middleman for mining sales, costing the DRC over $1.36 billion between 2010 and 2012 alone in revenues from underpriced mining assets sold to Gertler’s offshore companies.U.K. prosecutors have records showing that a DRC financial entity gave cash collected from local Congolese companies to “C,” who then paid an influential member of parliament described as the “right hand” man of the president. Payments were also made to people in senior positions in the DRC government. “C” later repaid those companies using Swiss bank accounts and the client account of a law firm.The court judgment suggested that “C” could only secure the goodwill and influence of the close presidential advisor by responding to “substantial, sometimes demanding, urgent and unforeseeable demands” from him via cash payments.More than 70% of the world’s cobalt comes from the resource-rich central African country, but more than 73% of its people live below the international poverty line.

       " 'Last week, Jean-Jacques Lumumba, former banker and well-known whistleblower from the Democratic Republic of Congo, believed that he was being followed while en route to Brussels’ main train station. Yet, he stuck to his plans and took a train to return to Paris, where he lives in exile. Halfway through the journey, as he prepared to switch trains in Lille, he realized that his bag with both his laptops was gone.Lumumba had gone to Brussels as spokesperson for a group of Congolese activists called “Dynamic Congo 2060.” During a press conference on July 24, he spoke about fighting corruption and impunity in Congo, upcoming election issues, and insecurity in the country’s east.Minutes after his presentation, he received a phone call from a trusted Congolese security source warning him that he might be under surveillance during his trip.On July 28, three days after Lumumba’s bag had disappeared, police summoned his tenants in Kinshasa, Congo’s capital, for interrogation. The police alleged that the house they rented, and which Lumumba owns, had been purchased with illegal funds and threatened them with eviction unless they provided documents containing personal information about their landlord.Two days later, Lumumba’s car was found burned-out in its parking place near his home on the outskirts of Paris. He filed a police report. \\xa0Lumumba was forced into exile in 2016 after he witnessed wrongdoings while working as an executive at the Congolese subsidiary of BGFI bank and revealed a massive corruption scandal involving the family of then-President Joseph Kabila and close associates. The trove of documents he disclosed, known as the Lumumba Papers, exposed a system of entrenched corruption, misuse of public funds, illegal financing, and embezzlement.“My wife and kids are shocked and scared,” Lumumba told Human Rights Watch by phone. Nevertheless, he remains committed to exposing and hoping to help rid Congo of corruption.\\xa0This new spate of intimidation and threats against Lumumba both in Europe and Kinshasa is of grave concern not just for Lumumba and those close to him, but to all those fighting corruption in Congo. Officials seeking to promote the rule of law in Congo should not only be investigating all allegations of corruption but also those seeking to deter whistleblowers from speaking out.\\xa0Access to Services for Survivors of Gender-Based Violence in Ethiopia’s Tigray RegionViolence Against Women and Girls During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Kenya',\n",

Something similar is happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at every point in a chain of bribe-taking that stretches from the lowest public officials to the top of the government. The DRC’s people are being harmed by a semi-official culture, known as “débrouillez-vous” (fend for yourself).What the Congolese think about corruption & briberyIn our survey of 47,000 citizens in 35 African countries, the Global Corruption Barometer, we asked DRC citizens about their views on and experiences of corruption. Eighty-five per cent said that corruption is increasing, 80 per cent said that the government is doing a bad job at tackling it, and 80 per cent said they need to pay bribes for public services, like the police, water supply and identification documents.It comes as little surprise that the Congolese see institutions like the police, the judiciary and the government as full of corruption, nor sadly, that less than a third think that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption.These findings are far worse than in most other African countries: slightly over half of all Africans think that corruption is getting worse, while 28 per cent of Africans have to pay bribes for public services.Why is corruption so prevalent in the DRC, why is bribery so commonplace and why do two thirds of citizens feel powerless?The state of corruption in the DRCA range of factors contribute to the DRC’s high corruption levels. Weak democracy allows corrupt politicians to maintain power, while ineffective institutions give opportunities for corruption rather than preventing it. People who expose or oppose corrupt systems are suppressed. The country also has low levels of stateness, a key tool that undemocratic regimes can use against corruption: the government doesn’t control its own army, competes for local power with many militias and has little control of movement through its eastern borders.The DRC’s leaders tend to drive corruption rather than try to clean it up. This is done through patronage networks where those with power give others jobs and contracts in exchange for bribes. This makes the powerful very rich — former President Joseph Kabila owns more than 80 companies and 71,000 hectares of farmland — and means that poorly paid low level officials have to demand bribes to survive.This act of preying on the people with less power is made more aggressive by job insecurity; leaders tend to strategically and regularly fire public officials to stop them from getting too much power. This encourages many officials to grab as much money as they can — through bribes and also embezzlement — as quickly as possible.They are able to do so undetected and with impunity because the DRC’s institutions are frequently not transparent — the state-owned oil company Cohyrdo is one of the world’s least transparent state-owned companies — and have low capacity to effectively monitor and manage their activities. This has led to hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure loans from the Chinese government going missing, for example.The chances of officials being sanctioned for corruption are further reduced by the DRC’s anti-corruption framework being very poorly implemented. Laws criminalising public sector corruption and requiring officials to report any bribery are rarely acted on, and any well-connected official who is prosecuted for corruption can expect an acquittal, as the judiciary is controlled by politicians and bribes.Citizens footing the billWhether it’s through slowed development or bribe-taking, it is ordinary citizens who suffer.The DRC’s 10 million market sellers are one of many demographics who get asked for bribes on a regular basis. A market seller’s drive to pick up goods might involve a traffic police officer demanding a bribe, an army run roadblock taking some of those goods and then a local government official requiring an unofficial tax to let the market seller trade.Local and provincial governments are known to demand hundreds of types of taxes, frequently for services that aren’t delivered. Many officials also pocket — and then bribe superiors with — large proportions of the taxes that they collect. Additionally, their need to deliver sufficient tax revenues to government accounts, whilst taking tax money for themselves, means that officials tax impoverished Congolese citizens at very high rates, taking 40 to 50 per cent of their income.There are, unfortunately, several reasons why two thirds of citizens don’t feel like they can make a difference against corruption: their votes are apparently not being counted in elections; the reported landslide winner of the 2018 general elections, Martin Fayulu, did not become president. Instead Felix Tshisekedi became president after an election involving many irregularities. Citizens are discouraged by protesters and opposition politicians being violently suppressed, and worry that the culture of fending for yourself is too deeply ingrained in their society.What’s next for the DRC?The Congolese can change their country and Felix Tshisekedi’s government has a chance to bring integrity to the DRC. It should start by strengthening democracy with a free press and judiciary, and full political rights. Tshisekedi must also adequately fund independent anti-corruption agencies, and fully implement the DRC’s anti-corruption framework. This will help strengthen its institutions while ensuring that state funds aren’t embezzled, procurement is ethical and corrupt acts are punished.A collection of articles, stories, analyses and opinions…5 5\\xa0claps5 Written byTransparency International is the global coalition fighting against corruption.

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File PhotoKINSHASA, July 5 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's former prime minister Matata Ponyo Mapon's parliamentary immunity was lifted on Monday, as the Senate leadership announced it had authorised a criminal investigation into allegations he misappropriated $140 million.Congo's public prosecutor last month accused Matata of ordering payments to people without valid claims to government compensation under a law meant to reimburse foreign businesspeople who had their properties seized in the 1970s.  read more The prosecutor, Jean-Paul Mukolo, said Matata personally benefited from the payments while serving as finance minister in 2011, but Mukolo did not provide evidence of this.Matata, who served as prime minister from 2012-2016, has not responded to requests for comment about the accusations.Senate president Modeste Bahati informed the prosecutor of the Senate leadership's decision in a letter seen by Reuters. The investigation could lead to eventual criminal charges.Last month, the Senate rejected a request by prosecutors to lift Matata's immunity over allegations he misappropriated funds from a failed agriculture project.  read more Matata denied those allegations and said they are part of a smear campaign against him.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

All rights reservedThe UAE’s record on illicit finance raises concerns for its relationship with the world’s poorest continent, experts say.\\xa0In 2018, the son of the president of the island nation of Comoros was back home in the capital city of Moroni and looking to make a buck.Nour El Fath Azali, a former bank auditor and American business school graduate, set up a shell company in the United Arab Emirates, according to records from the Pandora Papers investigation. The company, Olifants Ltd., offered consultancy and other advisory services.Months later, Comorian President Azali Assoumani appointed his son as a personal adviser. The younger Azali now works to persuade Emirati officials to invest in the Comoros, a small cluster of islands off the east coast of Africa with a government that international observers say is plagued by systemic corruption.Owning shell companies and bank accounts in the UAE, one of the world’s most secretive financial havens, is a growing trend among African politicians and their business allies.“The UAE is the center of the world,”\\xa0 Nour El Fath Azali, 37, recently told ICIJ media partner La Gazette des Comores.The Pandora Papers investigation discovered secretive Emirati financial interests of politicians and powerful business leaders from 17 African countries.The Pandora Papers, a global media collaboration that exposes the hidden financial deals of the world’s rich and powerful, is based on leaked records from 14 firms that help set up shell companies and bank accounts.\\xa0 Among these so-called offshore providers is SFM Corporate Services,\\xa0 based in the UAE’s financial capital, Dubai.“The UAE, de facto, tolerates illicit flows and trades that other more reputable international financial centers shun,” said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a University of Oxford professor who leads a research project on African countries and major financial centers, including Dubai. “In exchange for its acceptance that dubious players and monies be based in the country, the UAE merely asks wealthy Africans to stay out of local politics and stay within the boundaries of local law,” Soares de Oliveira said.Those drawn to the UAE praise its light-touch approach to business regulation and its convenient time zone, between those of Europe and Asia. UAE companies often provide generous tax exemptions to foreigners, and owners aren’t required to open an office or disclose their names on public registers.The UAE, de facto, tolerates illicit flows and trades that other more reputable international financial centers shun — Ricardo Soares de OliveiraFinancial crime experts and tax and law enforcement officials, however, point to the UAE’s history as a conduit for corrupt proceeds.The Persian Gulf nation has ignored money laundering for years, according to a 2020 report prepared by a team of international experts for the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, the main international organization for coordinating global anti-money laundering efforts. The report noted that the UAE is reluctant to share information about the owners of companies created there with authorities in other countries.Azali said, in response to questions from ICIJ, that he closed Olifants Ltd. in 2019 before it conducted any business and before he joined his father’s administration.Politicians worldwide, including many from Africa, have beaten a path to the UAE, according to the Pandora Papers and other media investigations.In 2018, a newly elected member of Kenya’s Parliament, Tindi Mwale, emailed SFM in Dubai, paying $2,641 to set up a company called Sahel & Scott Holdings Ltd and a bank account in the island nation of Mauritius.Mwale, who launched a real estate, engineering, consulting and construction conglomerate before entering politics in 2017, \\xa0told SFM that he planned to build roads, bridges, sewerage systems and oil pipelines. He signed emails with his government title, including a reference to the western Kenyan region he represents in Parliament: “Hon. Tindi Mwale, M.P. Butere Constituency.”Kenyan officials must declare to authorities their assets and wealth. In a brief telephone interview, Mwale denied owning an offshore company.“I’ve never chosen any company outside of Kenya,” Mwale told an ICIJ reporter in a telephone interview over WhatsApp before blocking the reporter’s phone number. “I’m even surprised that you are pushing things that are lies.”Be it a luxury villa,\\xa0 a shell company for holding hidden wealth, or the services of Dubai-based accountants or lawyers, the UAE has something for elites of all stripes, including Africa’s most influential politicians and business leaders.Isabel dos Santos, the oldest daughter of Angola’s former president, José Eduardo dos Santos, and her husband, the late Sindika Dokolo, lived in Dubai and owned or held shares in at least 10 UAE companies, according to ICIJ’s 2020 investigation, Luanda Leaks. The Pandora Papers revealed that Isabel dos Santos also worked with a corporate services company in the UAE to manage income received from Unitel, Angola’s largest mobile phone company.Dos Santos is wanted in Angola on charges that she caused the country to lose more than $1 billion from insider deals. Her husband died in 2020. Dos Santos denies wrongdoing and is reported to have remained in Dubai.Living near dos Santos in Dubai was Rukaiyatu Abubakar, a wife of Nigeria’s former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, who owned a four-bedroom apartment, according to a tenancy agreement in the Pandora Papers.Not far from Abubakar lived\\xa0 Farid Bedjaoui, the nephew of a former Algerian foreign minister.In 2013,Italian authorities charged Bedjaoui with bribery and corruption, alleging that he used his influence to inflate oil and gas contracts and then skimmed millions of dollars for himself. He was nicknamed “Mr. 3%” in some news reports, a reference to his alleged share of the illicit proceeds.\\xa0 Last year, Italy’s highest court acquitted him. Bedjaoui also owned a UAE company, according to the Pandora Papers.Prominent Africans aren’t the only rich and powerful people who have moved to the UAE.Nurali Aliyev, grandson of Kazakhstan’s president, lived on a famous palm tree-shaped artificial island in Dubai, according to the Pandora Papers. Another expatriate in Dubai was Delyan Peevski, a former Bulgarian member of Parliament whom the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned in 2021 for alleged corruption. Peevski used a UAE residency card to set up a shell company in the Seychelles. Under Bulgarian law, lawmakers cannot be official residents of other countries.Dos Santos, Bedjaoui, Aliyev, Peevski and their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. Paul Ibe, a spokesman for the Abubakar family, told ICIJ that Rukaiyatu Abubakar is a private citizen and that the couple purchased the Dubai property with funds from the former vice president’s “personal business investments.”Prominent nonresidents who did business in Dubai included Ali Khalif Galaydh, a former Somalian prime minister, according to the Pandora Papers. He was in Dubai in 2006 for a meeting of his company Somtel International Ltd., registered in the British Virgin Islands.Galaydh founded Somtel, a telecommunications company now with a major market share in Somalia, in the 1990s. The businessman and former government minister lived in Dubai before he became Somalia’s prime minister in October 2000. Somali lawmakers voted him out of office in October 2001, contending that he had failed to stanch lawlessness and violence in the war-torn country. He died in 2020.Minutes from a March 2006 meeting in Dubai show that Galaydh resigned as director of the BVI company that year and relinquished his shares. Also attending the meeting was fellow shareholder Abdourahman Boreh, a Djiboutian millionaire described in U.S. State Department cables as a “perennial confidante and business partner” of Djibouti’s dictatorial president, Ismaïl Omar Guelleh.In January 2013, records show, Djibouti’s communications minister, Abdi Houssein Ahmed, set up Issir Media Consulting Co. Ltd., an offshore company in the BVI. Ahmed managed his shell company through attorneys in Dubai and through the BVI and UAE offices of Trident Trust, one of the world’s largest offshore service providers. Ahmed created the shell company to own real estate, intellectual property and bank accounts, according to records.A former adviser to Djibouti’s foreign ministry, Ahmed, in 2011, was appointed minister of culture and communications, a post he held for five years. In documents that he submitted to set up the offshore company, he described himself as both a businessman and “public servant.”Under Djibouti’s constitution, holding the position of minister is “incompatible” with private sector activity.Ahmed did not respond to requests for comment.\",\n",

       " 'In late 2018, Charles Sipanje, the administrator of Zambia’s capital city, Lusaka, was cleaning house. Members of his team had embezzled almost $180,000, according to a government audit, and he was dealing with the mess. Sipanje dismissed staff members and appeared before the country’s legislature to apologize for fraud on his watch.He still had time to open a company in the UAE.On Aug. 13, 2018, Sipanje wired 3,213 euros (about $3,664) from his bank in Lusaka to SFM to create Atlantic Commodities Investment Ltd., according to emails and invoices in the Pandora Papers. He paid an additional $360 to open a bank account in Dubai.“See attached swift advice,” Sipanje wrote to SFM, typing on his iPad and referring to an identification code for the system that allows banks to send and receive money internationally.To help SFM confirm his identity, one of the service provider’s obligations under UAE due diligence rules, Sipanje shared recent bank statements. In 2018, the statements show, Sipanje spent almost $2,000 at Louis Vuitton and about $1,050 for a helicopter ride provided by a firm that specializes in sightseeing trips over Victoria Falls and the Zambezi River.In a curriculum vitae shared with SFM, Sipanje did not mention any government employment. At the time, he was paid about $37,000 a year as the top public official in the Lusaka region. Leaked records show SFM’s own research identified Sipanje as being involved in Zambian politics.Sipanje owns a company in Zambia with a name similar to that of its UAE counterpart, Atlantic Commodities Ltd. According to public records, the Zambia company held licences to explore almost 64,000 acres for gold and other minerals near the country’s border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sipanje’s Zambian company applied for its first mineral license on Sept. 26, 2018 — a month after he created his UAE firm.Sipanje was unapologetic about his use of the offshore system.“I do hope to one day wear a crown of a billionaire,” he told Zambian media in October after the publication of Pandora Papers news reports.In a follow-up interview, Sipanje told ICIJ that the UAE company was never operational and that he never opened a bank account. He said he has since asked SFM why its records indicated that he had.“Dubai is where the whole world goes,” Sipanje said. “Everyone who wants to do business, wants to be in Dubai.”Earlier this year, Zambia’s president dismissed Sipanje from his position as the chief bureaucrat of the country’s northern region. In August, his bid for a seat in Parliament failed. Now a private citizen, Sipanje told ICIJ that he will soon visit Dubai to finish setting up his company there.“In Zambia, we’ve got everything in terms of minerals. Where do you sell your commodities?” he asked. “All the big boys in Africa have to deal with Dubai.”Contributors: Hayatte Abdou (Comoros), Mahamoud Djama (La Voix de Djibouti), Charles Mafa and John Mukela (Makanday, Zambia), Lyas Hallas (Twala.info, Algeria) and Ntibinyane Ntibinyane (INK Center for Investigative Journalism, Botswana), Atanas Tchobanov (Bivol.bg, Bulgaria)Senior reporter and Africa coordinatorHelp us change the world.

       " \"File photoConflict and corruption are two main factors that have led to a drastic reduction of industrial activity in the Central African country of the Democratic Republic of the Congo over the past 60 years, claim experts.The country was touted as the highly industrialized nation in sub-Saharan Africa with 10,000 production units operating at the time of achieving independence from Belgium in 1960. But currently, only 500 industrial units are catering to the population of 105 million.Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Oscar Kimanuka, a Kigali-based political analyst, said corruption, lack of commitment, and political will on the part of the Congolese post-independent leaders were the main reasons leading to the downfall of industries.The political instability that started with the assassination of Patrice Emery Lumumba, the first prime minister, just a year after the independence also put roadblocks towards investments in the industries.“Industrialization was no longer a priority. Extraction of various minerals for the benefit of the West and a few selfish individual leaders became a priority for the governments,” said Kimanuka.He said only a few basic industries involved in processing minerals and other primary products for local consumption could survive.Now with President Felix Tshisekedi, who took over in 2019 unveiling the package known as the 2040 Master Plan for Industrialization, experts say the plan will not materialize in the wake of conflicts ragging the country.The eastern parts of DR Congo have been witnessing conflict with multiple foreign and local armed groups mushrooming in recent years.Nearly 500 civilians have been killed in North Kivu and South Kivu alone since the beginning of this year, according to the Kivu Security Tracker, a monitor focused on violence in eastern DR Congo.“Before this ambitious (industrial) project can take off, there is an urgent need to restore peace and security in the vast Central African nation. Peace and security are primary prerequisites to any nation's prosperity, including industrialization. Putting the cart before the horse cannot be realistic,” Kimanuka said.- Peace mandatory for a revival planKimanuka said only in an environment of peace and security there is hope to revive industrialization.The plan aims to achieve the objective of industrial growth and transform DR Congo, according to Congolese Industry Minister Julien Paluku.He said that over the next five years, the government wants to double the number of industrial production units from 500-1,000 and reduce import bills estimated at nearly $6.5 billion per year by 60%.To implement the plan, the government has split DR Congo into six industrial zones.These include the west in the Kinshasa region, the south in the former Katanga, the central zone in the Kasai area, the east zone in the three Kivu provinces, the northeast zone which includes the former Orientale province, and the north-west zone made up of the former Equateur.These industrial zones are expected to be transformed by 2040 into export hubs to neighboring countries.GREGORY BUTENGWA, Lusaka\",\n",
       " 'RECENTLY, United States (US) President Joe Biden announced that the White House had decided to host the world democracy video summit on December 9 and 10, 2021, to which 110 countries worldwide have been invited to participate.Biden says this summit aims to defend democracy, fight dictatorship and corruption and protect human rights and freedoms around the world.The US has also initially scheduled a physical conference next year, during which it will call on all democracies to uphold democratic values.Over the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has ravaged the world and killed millions of people,almost everything was getting worse in Africa as prices of essential commodities have been spiralling out of control. It is therefore widely felt that the US, as one of the superpowers, should have mainly focused on controlling epidemic prevention and helping improve growth, and not to defend freedom and democratic values.Of course the call for a democracy summit in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic leaves much to be desired and has surprised, if not disappointed, many stakeholders across the globe.African people have faced many problems in their lives over the two years of the dreadful disease. They have bought food and medicine with their limited living expenses,struggling to survive.They seek jobs regardless of dignity. However, this is a time when America, the largest democracy in the world, is talking about ideologies, instead of helping out the people in underprivileged countries.What do people need those ideologies for, if they find difficulty in living? This really confuses them.Of course democracy and freedom is good, but it cannot bring people any substantial benefits now. It is ridiculous to talk about these ideologies now when African people’s survival is in question, when survival is the first priority in Africa today.Among the countries President Biden has invited for the virtual democracy summit are Israel and Taiwan, which Beijing claims to be part of its territory, the move which is likely to further tension between the US and China.“I agree Taiwan more than qualifies – but it does seem to [the] democratic government that the US government does not officially recognise. So its inclusion is a big deal,” tweeted',\n",
       " 'Julian Ku, a Hofstra University law professor whose specialities include China. India, often called “the world’s biggest democracy”,will be present at the summit despite increasing criticism from human rights defenders over democratic backsliding under Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the Middle East, only Israel and Iraq have been invited. The traditional Arab allies of the US – Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan,Qatar and the United Arab Emirates – are all absent. Unsurprisingly, according to the guest list published on the US State Department’s website, America’s main rivals China and Russia are not on it.In Europe, Poland is represented despite recurring tensions with Brussels over respect for the rule of law,but Hungary far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban is not. On the African side,Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Niger are invited.“For this kick-off summit,there is a case for getting a broad set of actors into the room: it provides for a better exchange of ideas than setting a perfect bar for qualification,” Laleh Ispahani of the Open Society Foundation told AFP. Other than using the democracy summit as antiChina meeting, Ispahani urged Biden to address “the serious decline of democracy around the world – including relatively robust models like the US”.The summit is being organised as democracy has suffered setbacks in countries where the US had placed great hopes.Sudan and Myanmar have experienced military coups,Ethiopia is in the midst of a conflict that could lead to its “implosion”,according to US diplomats, and the Taliban took power in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of SU troops after two decades.Many stakeholders have questioned if the summit is just a talk show or it can effect change.But according to the Biden administration, the two-day virtual meeting is designed to help renew democracy around the world.The summit, the administration claims,will “focus on challenges',\n",
       " 'and opportunities facing democracies and will provide a platform for leaders to announce both individual and collective commitments, reforms and initiatives to defend democracy and human rights at home and abroad.” It will presumably end with bold pronouncements by leaders about reforms they intend to make both internationally and at home.Certainly, the summit comes at a challenging time for democracy. The global monitoring organisation Freedom House called this year’s report on the state of global freedom “Democracy Under Siege”.It noted that the global balance had shifted in favour of authoritarianism, and that the organisation also has recorded 15 straight years of declines in global freedom.Even military coups, once thought near-extinct relics of Among the countries the Cold War, are making a comeback, with coups this year',\n",
       " 'in Myanmar, Sudan and Guinea,among other places.But the Summit for Democracy is unlikely to have much of a lasting impact. To be sure, it is unreasonable to expect a two-day virtual summit to make major inroads into a phenomenon — global democratic regression — 15 years in the making and due to numerous causes, ranging from public dissatisfaction with democratic leaders’ handling of major issues to the growing strength of countries like China and Russia.A study by University of Cambridge researchers found that international dissatisfaction with democracy as a form of government has reached its highest level in more than two decades, with a vast range of factors underpinning this shift.A two-day summit is not going to just turn those attitudes around. And in some countries where it once seemed like democracy was making real headway, like Turkey',\n",
       " 'and Russia, the slide toward autocracy has been so great, it is hard to imagine a turnaround anytime in the near future — if at all.As Steven Feldstein of the Carnegie Endowment notes,more than 30 percent of the invitees are countries that are either not free or are only partly free, according to rankings by Freedom House in its 2021 Freedom in the World report.Inviting such a broad swath of countries dilutes the summit’s focus and clarity,costing the meeting, in some ways, the moral high ground.

       " 'AdvertisementSupported byThe Treasury Department slapped sanctions on the Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler in 2017 for corruption in Africa. In Donald Trump’s final days in office, they were rolled back with no explanation.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Eric LiptonWASHINGTON — In early December, an Israeli billionaire named Dan Gertler made an unusual request to the Treasury Department.A mining magnate who had been accused for years of corruption in deals he struck with leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr. Gertler had been slapped with stiff sanctions by the Trump administration in 2017, effectively cutting off his access to the international banking system and freezing money held in U.S. banks.He had unsuccessfully tried since then to get the sanctions rolled back by hiring high-powered lobbyists and lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, who had represented President Donald J. Trump in his first impeachment trial, and the former F.B.I. director Louis Freeh.But with time running out on the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration unlikely to give his pleas much of a hearing, Mr. Gertler put one last offer on the table: He would agree to have outside monitors track his business and submit regular reports on his financial transactions if the United States would lift the sanctions.The response came in mid-January, with only days left in Mr. Trump’s term: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin granted Mr. Gertler much of what he wanted, signing off, without any public announcement, on a one-year arrangement that gave him access to money frozen in U.S. banks and allowed him once again to do business with financial institutions worldwide.The decision stunned and angered American diplomats in Washington and Africa and government officials and human rights activists in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Mr. Gertler had been accused years earlier by the United Nations and other groups of working with the then-ruling family on deals that looted the nation’s mineral wealth and propped up a corrupt regime.And it has left the Biden administration scrambling to determine how Mr. Gertler managed to pull it off — and whether it can be reversed.The episode has echoes of Mr. Trump’s last-minute grants of clemency to political and personal allies and people with connections to him, including the involvement of Mr. Dershowitz. It also highlighted Mr. Gertler’s use of high-powered connections in Israel, including people with ties to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and an effort to win support from the U.S. ambassador to Israel.But the outcome was also distinguished by the secrecy of the process, which cut out the American diplomats most directly responsible for dealing with Congo and fighting corruption in Africa and appeared to have been handled largely at the level of Mr. Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The decision became public only after Mr. Trump had left office.The abrupt reversal of policy toward Mr. Gertler was extraordinary in a number of ways, an investigation by The New York Times found.Among the findings:The rapid decision to grant Mr. Gertler much of what he wanted defied Treasury Department norms, according to three former agency lawyers, effectively rolling back sanctions with no public documentation justifying the move and without broadly consulting officials at the State Department or the National Security Council. Only last year, some American diplomats and members of Congress in both parties were seeking to expand the sanctions on Mr. Gertler.Mr. Gertler tested the limits of federal law by hiring lawyers who also worked as lobbyists in Washington to push his case, including Mr. Dershowitz, who was instrumental in winning clemency from Mr. Trump for an array of clients, and Mr. Freeh. Treasury rules generally prohibit people under sanctions from spending money on lobbyists in the United States.The Treasury Department’s decision to grant Mr. Gertler a special license was based in part on an assertion that there was a “national security interest” for the United States in Mr. Gertler’s business dealings in Africa, lawyers involved in the effort and Israeli officials said. But some State Department officials were skeptical that his security value could outweigh the human, economic and moral damage contained in the allegations against him. It is also unclear how the balance could have shifted since sanctions were imposed in 2017.Pressure also came from Israel, where Mr. Gertler is represented by prominent lawyers including Boaz Ben Zur, whose client list also includes Mr. Netanyahu. David M. Friedman, then the U.S. ambassador there, was targeted in the push, and then notified Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Pompeo that he supported the sanctions relief Mr. Gertler wanted, assuming the Treasury Department could work it out.“I am astounded by this,” said John E. Smith, who served as the director of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control at the time the sanctions were imposed on Mr. Gertler. “It appears to be an abuse of the process.”Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Pompeo, who was also said to be supportive of the decision, both declined to comment.Mr. Gertler, in a statement, said the decision was not a result of any special influence campaign in Israel or the United States, but instead his promise to be more transparent about his business operations worldwide.“We will be adopting and implementing the most stringent anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies and measures across all our global practices,” Mr. Gertler said.But diplomats and human rights activists said they could see no justification for giving a break to Mr. Gertler, who was described by the Treasury Department in 2018 as “engaged in the looting of natural resources and the humanitarian consequences” that followed in poor, strife-torn Congo.Senior State Department officials in the Trump administration — including Michael Hammer, the U.S. ambassador to Congo; J. Peter Pham, a special envoy; and Tibor P. Nagy, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs — were not informed ahead of time of the move to grant Mr. Gertler the license, contrary to normal practice.“Here you have one of the most poverty-stricken nations, with a population that has suffered incredibly over the last several decades, and we have worked to turn that around, so why do this?” said Mr. Pham, who until Jan. 20 served as a senior State Department adviser on Africa.Mr. Gertler arrived in Congo in 1997 as a 23-year-old diamond dealer, determined to challenge the global giant in supplying raw diamonds, the South African-based De Beers. One of his first big breaks came about three years later, when Laurent Kabila, then the president of Congo, needed weapons to wage a war that would last for more than a decade.Offering monopolies to foreigners looking to tap into Congo’s rich mineral resources was a way for Mr. Kabila to raise cash needed to fight the war. Among them was a deal to export diamonds with Mr. Gertler, who was considered an appealing intermediary because of his ties to generals in the Israeli Army that could help Congo procure weapons, according to two reports issued by the United Nations in 2001. (Mr. Gertler disputed the findings.)But the U.N. concluded that Mr. Kabila used money gained selling access to the nation’s mineral wealth — including his deal with Mr. Gertler — to expand the Congolese military forces, a move that helped popularize the terms “conflict diamonds” and “blood diamonds.”“Conflict diamonds are exchanged for money, weapons and military training,” a U.N. report describing Mr. Gertler’s work said.Mr. Gertler was also indirectly accused, in a Justice Department court filing in 2016, of paying more than $100 million in bribes to government officials in Congo on behalf of a company named Och-Ziff “to obtain special access to and preferential prices for opportunities in the government-controlled mining sector.”A spokesman for Mr. Gertler, Aron Shaviv, said Mr. Gertler was never interviewed or charged in the case and he denied any wrongdoing. Instead, Mr. Shaviv said, Mr. Gertler’s companies have directly invested more than $1.5 billion in Congo, becoming one of the nation’s largest employers and taxpayers, starting when no other foreigners were willing to take the risk of doing business in the middle of a war.“He did buy cheap and he may sell at a much, much higher price because he made the investment when no one else did, no one else would dare go to Congo,” said Mr. Shaviv, a political consultant who served as Mr. Netanyahu’s campaign manager in 2015.Mr. Gertler first came onto the radar of White House officials in 2002, when Joseph Kabila, who took over the nation after his father was assassinated the prior year, sent a letter to President George W. Bush, looking for help to end the war.“Please accept my appointed emissary, Mr. Dan Gertler, a respected and well-known international businessman, to speak on my behalf for the needs of the Democratic Republic of Congo,” Mr. Kabila wrote in the April 2002 letter to Mr. Bush, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times.Correspondence from 2002 between Joseph Kabila, then president of Democratic Republic of Congo, and President George W. Bush about Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining executive.“He played a very pivotal role in not only advising Kabila, but also sort of speaking with authority and definitely carrying the United States’ message,” Jendayi E. Frazer, who then served as an adviser to Mr. Bush for African affairs, said in an interview.Mr. Gertler’s work helped lead to a peace deal in 2003. And it also cemented his relationship with Joseph Kabila. The Congolese government began to grant new deals to Mr. Gertler and his growing empire of companies, which expanded from diamonds into copper, cobalt, oil, gas and gold.In just five deals negotiated between 2010 and 2012 to sell copper and cobalt through offshore companies linked to the Fleurette Group, which is controlled by Mr. Gertler and his family, the citizens of Congo lost an estimated $1.36 billion because the nation’s resources were being sold at one-sixth of their value, according to a report prepared in 2013 by Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary general, and other prominent African officials.The forgone revenues to Congo from the deals “were equivalent to more than double the combined annual budget for health and education,” the report concluded.In Congo, over 70 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty, with an income of less than $1.90 a day. But the profits generated for Mr. Gertler were extraordinary, averaging 512 percent, according to the study, turning him into one of the 29 youngest billionaires in the world, according to Forbes.It was not just Mr. Gertler who was reported to be becoming tremendously wealthy through these deals.Joseph Kabila, who had called Mr. Gertler “an old and trusted friend,” was also taking a cut, according to a 2017 report by the nonprofit Congo Research Group, which found that Mr. Kabila and his family ended up as owners in part or whole of at least 80 companies. Among them was one mining deal with a business linked to Mr. Gertler that drew so many questions from the International Monetary Fund that the fund canceled disbursement of more than $200 million in loans it had planned to make under an agreement with Congo.The corruption and exploitation inherent in these types of deals were just the sort that a new appointee at the Treasury Department named Sigal P. Mandelker was determined to confront when she was confirmed as the top official in charge of sanctions enforcement in 2017.“Our objective is to change behavior, inspire democracy and freedom, and disrupt the ability of kleptocrats, human rights abusers and others from stealing the wealth of their country,” Ms. Mandelker said in a 2019 speech.Ms. Mandelker drew bipartisan praise for her effort to take advantage of new authority Congress granted to the Treasury in 2016. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, as the law is known, is named after a Russian tax lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after he exposed corruption by Russian officials.The new law allowed the Treasury to freeze the assets of individuals or businesses operating anywhere in the world that were engaged in “gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.”Working with the State and Justice Departments, Ms. Mandelker’s team included Mr. Gertler in the first round of individuals penalized in December 2017, citing his record of “opaque and corrupt” mining and oil deals in Congo. A second round of sanctions in 2018 targeted more companies affiliated with Mr. Gertler.The sanctions on Mr. Gertler severely constrained his ability to do business around the world by cutting off his access to the United States banking system and limiting his access even to non-U.S. financial institutions concerned about running afoul of the American law.But less than a year after the sanctions were imposed, Mr. Gertler began his campaign to roll them back.The push started with a seemingly innocuous request: Grant Mr. Gertler permission to use some of his money to make charitable donations to hospitals, libraries and schools in Congo. But even that plan drew concern from some State Department officials, who were worried that the donations would allow Mr. Gertler to bolster his standing in Congo and help supporters of Mr. Kabila, by then out of office, challenge efforts by the new, democratically elected president, Félix Tshisekedi, to assert control.By last year, Mr. Gertler was also battling to rebut a report by two human rights groups citing what they said was evidence that he was evading the sanctions by using a network of shell companies, frontmen and proxy bank accounts to move millions of dollars in and out of Congo and even to acquire new mining rights there.Mr. Gertler sued both the human rights groups and the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which published reports detailing the allegations. Lawyers working for Mr. Gertler and a bank in Congo claimed the reports were based on documents that were stolen and then tampered with. The paper and the human rights groups have defended the accuracy of their reporting.Instead of supporting Mr. Gertler’s bid for permission to make charitable donations, State Department officials responsible for Africa pressed the Treasury Department to expand the sanctions.But by the end of 2019, key players at the Treasury, including Ms. Mandelker, had started to leave the Trump administration, and State Department officials like Mr. Pham said they found it more difficult to get new Magnitsky sanctions imposed.The officials turned to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for help in keeping up the pressure on Mr. Gertler. In August, members of the committee sent the Treasury Department a bipartisan letter that did not mention him by name but carried a clear message.To help build democracy and fight corruption in Congo, the letter said, the United States “should designate additional officials and companies responsible for or complicit in high-level corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, for targeted financial and travel sanctions.”But Mr. Gertler’s team, including Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Freeh, had a different message. They had solicited a letter from Ms. Frazer attesting to Mr. Gertler’s role in the peace negotiations nearly two decades earlier and distributed it to Trump administration officials. As far back as 2019, they set up meetings with State Department officials, making the case that his activities had helped the interests of the United States.“His first effort was a lobbying effort,” Mr. Shaviv said of Mr. Gertler’s campaign.But Treasury rules state that “professional services such as lobbying, public relations, government affairs, consulting and business development are not legal services, and are generally not covered” by an exemption that allows people under sanctions to hire lawyers.Mr. Dershowitz said the meetings were permitted because he did not lobby the White House or others on this matter.“My role was purely limited to the legal issues,” Mr. Dershowitz said.But with time running out on Mr. Trump’s tenure and the sanctions still not lifted, Mr. Gertler decided to make a strategy shift. While not admitting any past wrongdoing, Mr. Gertler’s lawyers told the Treasury Department in early December that he was prepared to take any reasonable steps to assure the United States that he would abide by the law, including hiring outside monitors and submitting detailed periodic reports on financial transactions.“Our entire approach was to assure them that going forward, there would be no problem,” Mr. Shaviv said.At the same time, assertions were being made that Mr. Gertler had been of value to U.S. intelligence agencies.“It’s absolutely the case that the national security interests of both Israel and the United States were implicated in this,” Mr. Dershowitz said, although he and others declined to provide any specifics. Mr. Shaviv declined to discuss whether Mr. Gertler had undertaken any such activities, but said that if they did take place, they would be described as “services rendered to the United States of America.”Whatever Mr. Gertler did that benefited the United States was sensitive enough that Israeli officials said they were aware of it but declined to comment on its nature. Two Israeli officials told The Times that the United States had informed Israel that in line with a decision by Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Pompeo, the terms of the sanctions imposed on Mr. Gertler would be eased “out of reasons of American national security.”But several former State and Treasury Department officials said that while as a foreigner operating in Congo Mr. Gertler might have had information the United States considered valuable, keeping him on the sanctions list also had a value to Washington by helping to promote the anti-corruption effort.“The only value to national security that Gertler has comes from him being placed in the box that he was put into with the sanctions,” Mr. Pham said.In any case, the decision to grant him the one-year license was unusual in a number of respects, they said.The Treasury Department traditionally agrees to revoke sanctions only after individuals have proved they have already changed their behavior, not simply agreed to make such changes in the future, said Mr. Smith, the former head of the sanctions unit, who is now a national security lawyer at the law firm Morrison and Foerster. Mr. Gertler had not previously provided the United States such evidence.Furthermore, if Mr. Gertler’s assets in U.S. banks were going to be unfrozen and his corporate entitles allowed to once again do business with United States financial institutions, as the license allowed, that kind of deal would almost certainly need to be made public, not issued in secret as this one was. This kind of review also typically takes months of effort, not the six weeks that it took in this case.“This is a unique, one-of-a-kind response that you don’t see with the United States government,” Mr. Smith said of the so-called specific license that Mr. Gertler received. “It is the most shocking license I have ever seen in a few decades of working on economic sanctions.”When word of the decision to grant Mr. Gertler the one-year license eventually trickled out after Mr. Trump left office, it set off a firestorm of criticism from officials who said it would undercut efforts by the United States to fight corruption.Mr. Hammer, the U.S. ambassador to Congo, was at first \\u200bso \\u200bconfused at the news, according to one State Department official briefed on the matter, \\u200b\\u200b\\u200bthat he\\u200b called officials in Washington to figure out if \\u200ba \\u200bmistake had been made.“This has made my job much tougher\\u200b\\u200b,” an angry Mr. Hammer told colleagues.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bHouse and Senate Democrats fired off letters to the Treasury and State Departments. A coalition of 30 Congolese and international human rights groups assailed the move, with one of the letters calling the move a “terrible blow to the heart of one of the most lauded and effective anti-corruption programs of the last decade.”The Biden administration is now investigating why the license was issued, and if it could be revoked, although Mr. Gertler’s team said that it would have no justification to take such a step.Mr. Gertler, meanwhile, has begun a campaign to rehabilitate his image in Congo, releasing promotional videos detailing his work to support local hospitals and schools there and calling the citizens of Congo “brothers and sisters.” He also started a plan to allow residents of Congo to invest in one of his new mining projects.Activists in Congo were not impressed.“How can someone who has done so much harm to Congo for 20 years suddenly say he’s an angel?” said Jimmy Kande, a leader in the nonprofit group Congo Is Not for Sale. “If Congolese authorities would finally look at Gertler’s past, he shouldn’t have much of a future in Congo.”Kenneth P.

       " \"8884TH MEETING (AM)Through a presidential statement, the Security Council urged signatory states of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as regional organizations and the international community, to coordinate their efforts to undercut the economic lifelines of armed groups that benefit from the illegal exploitation and trade in natural resources, and to prevent the exploitation of women and children in the trade of these resources.By the text (document S/PRST/2021/19), presented by Kenya, Council President for October, the 15‑member organ stressed that there is no purely military solution to the threat posed by armed groups, and that their elimination will require an integrated and regional approach by Governments in the region, with the support of United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and the Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General for the Great Lakes Region.It condemned continued illicit exploitation of and trade by armed groups and criminal networks in natural resources in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region, particularly in so-called “conflict-minerals” like tin, tantalum, gold and diamonds as well as cocoa, timber and wildlife.  As well, it condemned the negative impact of armed conflict on protected natural areas, which undermines lasting peace and development for the Great Lakes Region.  Further, it recalled that individuals and entities involved in destabilizing activities through the illicit exploitation or trade in natural resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may be designated by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004).Huang Xia, Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General for the Great Lakes Region, presented the Secretary‑General’s latest biannual report on the implementation of the 2013 Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region (document S/2021/836).  He noted that, despite progress, challenges remained, including an upsurge in attacks by armed forces that were destabilizing the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Such violence exacerbates the already fragile humanitarian situation, he said, adding that the armed groups are financed by the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources.Putting an end to the activities of these negative forces is “an old question that haunts everyone interested in the region”, he observed.  However, despite such persisting challenges, countries in the region remain committed to peace and development, he said, highlighting a workshop recently co-organized by his Office in Khartoum, which helped generate 31 recommendations “both ambitious and realistic” geared towards ending the link between the smuggling of some high-value minerals and the financing of armed groups.Martha Ama Akyaa Pobee, Assistant Secretary‑General for Africa, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, while shedding light on the deteriorating humanitarian situation and the heavy toll on civilians, particularly women and children, also spotlighted the commitment by the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to provide adequate resources for the disarmament, demobilization, community recovery and stabilization programme that was recently established.  Success of this national programme will contribute tremendously to sustainable peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she said, calling on international partners and donors to also support these efforts.João Samuel Caholo, Executive Secretary of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, pointed out that peacekeeping missions in the region have a fundamental role in reducing the criminal exploitation of natural resources and contributing to stability and economic recovery.  Such missions, he said, should participate in joint security efforts to dislodge rebel and militia groups from mining sites where armed groups use such revenues to finance conflict, and entrust those sites to Government institutions, rather than national security forces.Speakers throughout the meeting expressed concern over an upsurge in violent attacks in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Many emphasized the need to tackle the root causes behind the conflict — the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources — which fuels the activities of armed groups, thereby destabilizing the region and worsening the humanitarian situations.Tunisia’s representative, who was one among many voicing such concerns, stressed that the region’s wealth should become the driver of development, not a source of funding for the armed groups.Meanwhile, the representative of France underscored the need for tighter regulation and monitoring of the exploitation of gold, stating that the Security Council should sanction individuals and entities involved in the exploitation of natural resources.In a similar vein, Colm Brophy, Minister for Overseas Development and Diaspora of Ireland, pointed out that “competition for control of resource-rich areas fuels hostilities and violence.”  Such challenges were further exacerbated by climate change, population displacement, extreme poverty, socioeconomic inequality and a lack of opportunities for young people.Téte António, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola, noting that his country assumed the Presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region in November 2020, drew attention to the high-level diplomatic initiatives to strengthen cooperation in security matters.  A Contact and Coordination Group has been established by Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda with the task of coordinating the implementation of non-military measures to complement military operations against negative forces in the region, he said.Niger’s representative, along with other delegates, commended the increase in diplomatic efforts among leaders in the Great Lakes region to address issues ranging from the exploitation of natural resources to the flow of refugees.  Encouraging the Central African Republic to increase the transparency of its disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation plans, he applauded the recent ceasefire declaration, calling it “an act of political courage”.The representative of Burundi, for his part, commended all the efforts that resulted in the removal of his country from the Council’s agenda, stating that his Government, elected in 2020, has devised a National Development Plan focussing on good governance, economic growth, social protection and national reconciliation.  However, economic development in the region is hobbled by a lack of funding, which if unaddressed may in turn undermine peace efforts, given the negative impact of climate change on development, he said.Claude Ibalanky Ekolomba, High Representative of the President and Coordinator of the National Monitoring Mechanism of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, outlined steps his Government has taken to stabilize the conflict in the eastern provinces to better implement its commitments under the Framework Agreement.  The state of siege imposed in Ituri and North Kivu earlier this year enabled progress in stabilizing the region, including the dismantling of networks that resupply the groups, and the release of hostages, among others.He urged countries in the region and the international community to adhere to the Framework Agreement in order to tackle the root causes of conflict, including through the combat of illegal exploitation of natural resources and arms trafficking.  Towards that end, President Félix Tshisekedi Tshilombo has forged economic cooperation with Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda, he pointed out, adding that he hoped the upcoming meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism on 8 December in Kinshasa will not be an “empty ceremony”, but will instead lend new momentum to the Agreement and spur participants to adhere to their commitments.Also speaking today were ministers, senior officials and representatives of Kenya, Norway, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Mexico, Estonia, Russian Federation, Viet Nam, the United States, India, the United Kingdom, China, Uganda and Rwanda.The meeting began at 10:09 a.m. and ended at 1:25 p.m.BriefingHUANG XIA, Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General for the Great Lakes Region, presented the biannual report on the Implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region (document S/2021/836), covering the period from 16 March to 15 September.  Recalling that the countries of the region remain committed to peace and development and look to the international community to support their efforts, he said the report takes into account both the progress made and the challenges that persist.He welcomed the continuing political dialogue between countries of the region, noting that the increase in State visits have spurred bilateral relations and revitalized cooperation in realms including security, trade, infrastructure, transport, natural resources and energy.  He highlighted encouraging political and symbolic gestures, including meetings between the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his counterparts from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, as well as the continued commitment of the President of Angola — the current Chairman of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region — to support national reconciliation efforts in the Central African Republic.He also welcomed the peaceful elections in Zambia and the subsequent smooth transfer of power, as well as Kenya’s contribution of troops to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) to help defeat armed forces rampant in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  As part of these efforts, the launch of the Contact and Coordination Group aims to incentivize the surrender and voluntary disarmament of armed groups, he said, adding that such measures will complement the efforts led by the Democratic Republic of the Congo through its Disarmament, Demobilization, Community Recovery and Stabilization Program.Despite such progress, challenges remain, he noted.  There has been an upsurge in attacks by armed forces, including those destabilizing eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Résistance pour un État de droit au Burundi (RED Tabara), which attacked the Bujumbura airport last September.  Such violence exacerbates the already fragile humanitarian situation and affects socioeconomic stability, he said, adding that the armed groups are financed by the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources.  Ending these negative forces is “an old question that haunts everyone interested in the region”, he commented, spotlighting the workshop on natural resources in Khartoum from 31 August to 2 September that his Office co-organized.  This event helped generate 31 recommendations “both ambitious and realistic” which aims to put an end to the link between the smuggling of some high-value minerals and the financing of armed groups.  In addition, his Office and the Conference will work to sensitize countries of transit and destination of such minerals to support efforts to bring such activities to a halt.Turning to the COVID‑19 pandemic, which has compounded the region’s prevailing socioeconomic fragilities, he underlined the low rate of vaccines administered in the region and reiterated the Secretary‑General’s call for greater solidarity with developing countries.  His Office developed an inclusive action plan last July aimed at facilitating vaccine access and bolstering existing health systems.  He reiterated his commitment to working with relevant United Nations bodies in the region, as well as with the Peacebuilding Fund, to ensure the plan’s full implementation, and called on the Council and the international community for their support.Such positive developments in the region can be attributed to initiatives aiming to fulfil objectives designated through the 2006 International Conference on the Great Lakes Region Framework Agreement, he said, underlining the importance of countries in the region implementing recently signed bilateral agreements and commitments made through regional and international instruments.  In this context, he welcomed upcoming summit meetings including the tenth Regional Oversight Mechanism summit in Kinshasa in December.JOÃO SAMUEL CAHOLO, Executive Secretary of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, said that the Conference has made progress in peace, stability and development despite the heinous criminal activity in the region, including the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources and increased sexual violence by armed groups.  The Conference’s recent meetings — including that on the security and political crisis in the Central African Republic — demonstrate that it has become a regional platform to address inter‑State tensions.  The Conference’s commitment to deepen and consolidate democracy in the region is further evidenced by “the organization of peaceful and credible elections in Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania, Congo and Zambia”, as well as increased participation by women in decision‑making bodies, he said.Turning to peacekeeping missions in the region, he said that such missions play a fundamental role in reducing the criminal exploitation of natural resources; contributing to stability and economic recovery; and enhancing the technical capacity of national authorities and local security forces in their management of local resources.  Peacekeeping missions should participate in joint security efforts to dislodge rebel and militia groups from mining sites where armed groups use such revenues to finance conflict.  Those sites should be placed in the hands of Government institutions, rather than national security forces.  He also stressed that the international community must play a role in strengthening cross-border security and combatting transborder crime and terrorism.  For its part, the Conference is working to establish an early warning system for the region to share information in real time.On disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation plans, he called on the international community to provide technical and financial support for such efforts — including intensive peace education and economic empowerment for ex-combatants — as these initiatives depend on reliable funding streams.  These programs must ensure that targeted communities benefit from them, he stressed, adding that they should be linked to broader national reform.  Though costly, they have had positive effects on building social cohesion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Burundi and the Central African Republic.  Even more could be achieved in the Great Lakes region, he noted, if the sharing of information and coordination between borders is enhanced.  He also called on all stakeholders to help attract investment in the region, design programs to create youth employment and support the Conference’s mineral-due-diligence efforts.MARTHA AMA AKYAA POBEE, Assistant Secretary‑General for Africa, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, said that the persistent insecurity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo east remains one of the main challenges facing the region today.  National and foreign armed groups continuing to perpetrate deadly attacks against civilians, further deteriorating the already dire humanitarian situation.  Since the beginning of this year, at least 1,043 civilians have been killed, including 233 women and 52 children.  This in turn shed light on underlying causes of the conflicts in the region, including, among others, the presence of foreign armed groups, the illegal exploitation of natural resources, intercommunal tensions, limited State presence in remote areas, marginalization and exclusion, youth unemployment and poverty.Governments of the region continue to prioritize military operations as part of their efforts to address the threat posed by armed groups in eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she continued.  She commended President [Félix Antoine] Tshisekedi Tshilombo’s decision to establish an operational centre in Goma to enhance cooperation between MONUSCO and the FARDC in the conduct of intelligence-driven operations against armed groups in Ituri and North Kivu provinces.  These military operations should be conducted in strict compliance with the human rights due diligence policy.  However, all initiatives must translate into actions.  In that regard, she welcomed the adoption of a three‑year action plan of the Contact and Coordination Group aimed at neutralizing the “negative forces” through a non-military approach.  MONUSCO and the Office of the Special Envoy will continue to support this Group through the establishment of an operational unit to be hosted in Goma.She also commended the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for their commitment to provide adequate resources for the disarmament, demobilization, community recovery and stabilization programme that was recently established.  Success of this national programme will contribute tremendously to sustainable peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she said, calling on international partners and donors to also support these efforts.  Among the main root causes of conflict are the illegal exploitation and regional trafficking of natural resources, which not only contribute to finance armed group networks but also creates parallel economy at the expense of States’ revenues.  The path towards sustainable peace and development also requires the meaningful participation of women, youth and the private sector.  MONUSCO and the Office of the Special Envoy will continue to ensure the participation of women and youth in local political and peace processes and work with the United Nations country team to support peacebuilding and stabilization efforts within the framework of the peace-development-humanitarian nexus.StatementsRAYCHELLE OMAMO, Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Kenya and Council President for October, spoke in her national capacity, observing that few parts of the world exemplify the notion of “paradox” than Africa’s Great Lakes region.  Home to the second largest rainforest and a critical lung for the planet, the region is the catchment area for Africa’s largest rivers and lakes and a habitat of impressive biodiversity.  As well, the Great Lakes region is endowed with a vast and unmatched array of precious and rare minerals as well as a rich pool of oil reserves and other hydrocarbons.  However, a great disconnect exists between the region’s potentials and the reality of pervasive poverty, underdevelopment and instability that has plagued this area for centuries.  This is due, in part, to an incessant cycle of brutal extraction, illicit exploitation, pillage and trafficking of the region’s natural resources.“We are here today to reinvigorate and renew the Council’s commitment to support the regional Governments,” she stated.  Proposing five courses of action, she said that first, capacity‑building and other assistance must be provided to resource-endowed countries to enable the development and implementation of policies, strategies and mechanisms for managing natural resources.  Second, enhanced support should be provided to national security and law enforcement agencies for improved security around the mining regions, transit routes and border areas.  Third, platforms for inclusive dialogue must be created to rebuild trust and confidence between mining communities, local authorities, extraction entities and merchants.  Fourth, regional countries should work together to deploy a range of military and non-military options to deal with armed groups.  The non-military measures may include disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration programmes for the ex-combatants.  Fifth, she called for greater regional cooperation to deepen the economic integration of the affected countries with a special focus on the productive utilization of national resources.COLM BROPHY, Minister for Overseas Development and Diaspora of Ireland, recognizing progress in the region, underlined the centrality of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework and expressed hope that the upcoming meeting of its oversight mechanism will help maintain the current momentum.  He also welcomed the United Nations Strategy for Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention, and Conflict Resolution.  However, he noted his concerns over the illegal exploitation and trade of minerals and natural in the region.  “Competition for control of resource-rich areas fuels hostilities and violence,” he said, adding that climate change, population displacement, extreme poverty, socioeconomic inequality and the lack of opportunities for young people are also exacerbating challenges.  Calling for good governance approaches and cooperation, he said Ireland will continue supporting the Kimberley Process Certification scheme and implementing the European Union’s Conflict Minerals Regulation, among others.  Action is also needed to address the region’s humanitarian and displacement crises, he said, also urging all parties to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance.NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) emphasized that enhanced regional cooperation must translate into specific action for the protection of civilians in the Great Lakes region, including humanitarian actors that are still victimized by armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It is also important to ensure coordination among security actors on the ground and with MONUSCO.  Further, he stressed the need to contain the illegal exploitation of natural resources — a main cause of instability — as this helps finance armed groups and criminal networks, feeds conflict and compounds tensions between States.  Gold exploitation, in particular, is not sufficiently monitored and must be more tightly regulated.  To that end, the Council must sanction individuals and entities involved in natural resource exploitation.  He also stressed that, as MONUSCO transitions, United Nations agencies should enhance their presence in the Great Lakes region, and donors should mobilize to support implementation of the United Nations regional strategy and to meet humanitarian needs.MONA JUUL (Norway) noted the positive advances in cooperation in the Great Lakes region, including on action against armed groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It is vital that the United Nations and the global community support those efforts, she stressed, adding that the adoption of the Strategy for the Great Lakes Region and its accompanying Action Plan are a good starting point.  However, the illicit trade of natural resources in the region, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually, is a root driver of conflict, draining public revenue and seriously impacting States’ ability to protect and provide for their populations.  She expressed hope that the endorsement of the recommendations by Heads of State at the upcoming International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, together with existing mechanisms, can contribute to curbing revenue streams to armed groups and advancing the transparent and sustainable management of natural resources in the region.INGA RHONDA KING (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) urged that continued efforts ensure women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all stages of the political, peace and development processes.  Expressing concern over the volatile security situation in the region, including the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic, she welcomed President [Faustin-Archange] Touadera's unilateral declaration of a ceasefire as a fundamental step towards the implementation of the Peace Agreement and called on all parties to follow suit.  Highlighting the humanitarian situation across the region, she pointed to a significant number of internally displaced people, with many experiencing food insecurity.  She called for sustained support, including through contributions to the relevant humanitarian response plans.  Voicing her hope regarding the United Nations Strategy for Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution in the Great Lakes Region, she also urged States to address the root causes and drivers of endemic violence, particularly the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources.JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMIREZ (Mexico) welcomed the achievements of regional diplomacy, including the normalization of relations between Burundi and Rwanda, and the strengthening of ties between the latter country and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  While underscoring the positive effects these regional dynamics have had on peace and security — including the revitalization of the political agreement in the Central African Republic — he pointed out that significant challenges remain; those are a result of the actions by armed groups that produce security issues and hinder the provision of humanitarian assistance.  Tackling the root causes of violence must be a priority and robust action must be taken to address the exploitation and trafficking of natural resources.  Further, he stressed that more specific efforts must be implemented to combat the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons, adding that policies to manage arms and munitions must complement the broader strategy of disarmament and demobilization.TAREK LADEB (Tunisia) noted that the region is witnessing political, economic and security challenges, which are being exacerbated by the COVID‑19 pandemic.  Noting that the pillaging of natural resources finances the activities of armed groups, he stressed that the region’s wealth must become the driver of development, not a source of funding for the armed groups.  Emphasizing the importance of full implementation of the regional peace and security framework, he welcomed the regional summit of Heads of State held in Uganda in September as an opportunity to pull their efforts together.  Paying tribute to the work of the Special Envoy, including his good Offices and assistance in capacity‑building, he also underscored the long‑term value of the United Nations Strategy for Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution for the Great Lakes region.  He lauded the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund, reaffirmed support for regional organizations, including the African Union, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the East African Community, and endorsed the Presidential Statement adopted today.SVEN JÜRGENSON (Estonia) said the insecurity over two decades in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo destabilizes the region, leading to day-to-day killings of civilians, as well as conflict-related sexual violence, “behaviour unworthy of human beings”.  The conflict in the region has plunged the population in a dire humanitarian situation and has left them experiencing critical levels of food security.  “It is inconceivable that about 15 million people in the region are subjected to forced displacement,” he stressed, adding, that this should not happen to populations in these times.  He underlined the importance of greater regional cooperation to consolidate control over conflict minerals and mining sites and welcomed efforts towards regional cooperation and dialogue by countries in the region in this regard.  He encouraged the implementation of regional databases on mineral flows as well as the harmonization of regional regulations.  He also called for the strengthening of the national disarmament, demobilization and stabilization programme, spotlighting the role of investigative authorities and regional courts in addressing accountability for illegal exploitation of natural resources.ANNA M. EVSTIGNEEVA (Russian Federation) said the situation in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo remains challenging, observing that while the situation in Tanganyika Province has been stabilized, armed groups such as the Allied Democratic Forces continue to be active in North Kivu.  More is needed to be done to ensure the extraction of minerals takes place in an orderly manner.  She also noted that exclusively military means will not bring about lasting normalization of the situation in the region.  She took note of positive steps taken by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to resolve border disputes, and to implement disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programmes for former combatants.  She also welcomed heightened diplomacy efforts by countries in the region and commended the role played by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region under the presidency of Angola in supporting such efforts.  The successes underscored her country’s conviction that African problems must be addressed by African solutions, she stressed, adding that it is nefarious to try to impose ready-made formulas or interfere from the outside.ABDOU ABARRY (Niger) welcomed the recent increase in diplomatic efforts among leaders in the Great Lakes region to address issues such as the exploitation of natural resources and the flow of refugees.  Encouraging the Central African Republic to increase the transparency of its disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation plans, he called the recent ceasefire declaration “an act of political courage”.  Condemning armed groups’ attacks in that country, as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he welcomed regional efforts to end this violence.  Military action cannot be ruled out to resolve insecurity in the region; however, non‑military measures designed to address the drivers of conflict will help consolidate peace.  In this quest for peace in a region so vast and rich in natural resources, it is necessary to strengthen bilateral ties among countries in the region and ensure synergy between the various subregional organizations to which those States belong, he stressed.HAI ANH PHAM (Viet Nam), emphasizing the vital importance of regional cooperation in conflict prevention and resolution, said it also plays a central role in tackling the illegal activities of armed groups, the illicit exploitation of and trade in natural resources and the adverse impacts of natural disasters and the COVID‑19 pandemic.  Commending progress on regional cooperation in the Great Lakes region, he nevertheless said the humanitarian situation remains worrisome, especially in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  While welcoming the gradual return of refugees in Burundi, he expressed concern over the plight of millions of displaced people and refugees, as well as the more than 27 million people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that face crisis‑level food insecurity.  In that context, he encouraged the further intensification of cooperation to implement the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, to strengthen management of nature resources and to tackle threats posed by armed groups.LINDA THOMAS‑GREENFIELD (United States) expressed support for the principles of the United Nations Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution in the Great Lakes region and encouraged the Special Envoy to swiftly implement it through shuttle diplomacy.  She also welcomed the work towards establishing a regional oversight mechanism and Kenya’s focus on natural resources, adding that, as noted in the meeting, the illegal trade of natural resources is clearly fuelling violence in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Urging Governments in the region to uphold their commitments, she called for responsible management of natural resources, including due diligence for the private sector.  If regional State actors work together to carry out legal trade of natural resources, the difference will be extraordinary, she said.T. S. TIRUMURTI (India) said armed groups remain the main cause for insecurity in many countries of the region.  As well, the porous international borders remain a major impediment in combating these groups, he said, welcoming high-level regional diplomacy and the reinvigoration of the bilateral mechanisms to strengthen border control, sharing of information and intelligence and border infrastructure development.  The illegal exploitation, trafficking and illicit trade of natural resources have contributed to armed conflict in the region; existing systems and efforts at the regional level need be strengthened further to address the issue.  India has close bilateral relationships with all countries in the Great Lakes region.  A key driver of these relationships is the people-to-people contact that has existed for many years, he said, drawing attention to a large Indian diaspora in the region.  India has collaborated through exchange of experts, training and capacity building programs and enhanced support towards post-conflict reconstruction in the region, he noted.JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom) said the concept note for today’s meeting rightly identified the illegal exploitation and trade in natural resources as a key conflict driver and multiplier of destabilising forces.  He called on regional Governments to play their part by ramping up national efforts to tackle corruption and improve the rule of law and domestic taxation.  Expressing deep concern that the United Nations Group of Experts for the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been on hold since August, he said that this has prevented the Group from providing their concrete and actionable reporting on illicit smuggling of natural resources in the region.  While continuing to focus on natural resource exploitation, it is important to discuss and address other priority areas including but not limited to human rights, good governance, freedom of expression and civil liberties in the Great Lakes, he said.ZHANG JUN (China), stressed that peace and development in the region faces a window of opportunity.  Emphasizing the need to maintain the momentum of cooperation, he called on States to adhere to eliminate the root causes of conflicts.  The competition over natural resources was due to poverty and underdevelopment, he said, underscoring that countries in the region should strictly regulate and enforce the exploitation and utilization of natural resources; strengthen regional cooperation to combat their illegal exploitation and trade; and cut off the channels of illegal profits for armed groups.  He also pointed out that the COVID‑19 vaccination rate in the region is only 6 per cent and cited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that it will be difficult for countries in the region to return their per capita income to the pre-pandemic levels before 2025.  Calling for increased vaccine assistance to the region and pragmatic measures in debt relief and development assistance to help with pandemic response and recovery, he noted that 12 countries in the region are using Chinese vaccines.TÉTE ANTÓNIO, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola, recalled that his country assumed the Presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region in November 2020, with an aim to enhance the Conference’s capacity to address the challenges of peace, security, stability, and development in the region, with the support of partners including the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations.  Despite the achievements under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement, the illicit exploitation of natural resources, tense relations between countries, refugees and internally displaced persons, humanitarian issues and growing terrorist threats continue to threaten the stability of the region.  As such, preventive diplomacy, sustainable development through the promotion of investments and increased participation of international financial institutions and the private sector are needed.He went on to say that as part of the high-level diplomatic initiatives to strengthen cooperation in security matters, a Contact and Coordination Group has been established by Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda with the task of coordinating the implementation of non-military measures to complement military operations against negative forces in the region.  However, the illicit exploitation and trade of natural resources is one of the key drivers of instability.  It is therefore of fundamental importance that the nexus between natural resources and conflicts must be brought to bear in the formulation of adequate responses and mitigation measures, he said.CLAUDE IBALANKY EKOLOMBA, High Representative of the President and Coordinator of the National Monitoring Mechanism of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said that despite formidable challenges, his country is determined to implement all its commitments under the Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework Agreement.  Recalling that President Félix Tshisekedi Tshilombo imposed a state of siege in Ituri and North Kivu earlier this year to counter the activities of armed groups, he outlined progress, including the neutralization of hundreds of militia members, the recovery of munitions, the dismantling of networks that resupply the groups, the release of hostages, a decrease in raids on civilians and the reopening of some roads previously under armed groups’ control.  Pointing out that a combination of military and non-military solutions is required to bring the situation under control, he called on the Security Council to express its support for the siege as well as other programmes his Government is undertaking, including disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programmes.Consolidating peace in the region entails tackling the root causes of destabilization, including through the combat of illegal exploitation of natural resources and arms trafficking, he continued.  In this regard, he called on countries in the region and the international community to adhere to the Framework Agreement, adding that President Tshekedi has forged economic cooperation with Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda.  The state of gridlock around the security situation must be overcome to achieve technical reforms laid out in the Framework, he stressed.  To this end, the National Monitoring Network has outlined a roadmap, which focusses on identifying and tackle the root causes of conflict, strengthening capacities at all levels, supporting national cohesion and strengthening national and regional cooperation.  He expressed his hope that the upcoming meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism on 8 December in Kinshasa will not be an “empty ceremony”, but will instead lend new momentum to the Agreement and spur participants to adhere to their commitments.ADONIA AYEBARE (Uganda) highlighted the region’s renewed sense of optimism in improved bilateral relations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbours — with a specific focus on addressing the root causes and drivers of conflict and instability.  Welcoming renewed cooperation between the countries, he said relations between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are excellent.  Another example of enhanced cooperation was the mini‑summit in October 2020 of the Heads of States of Uganda, Rwanda, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The Heads of State agreed to strengthen surveillance and control measures in response to COVID‑19 and other pathologies with epidemic potential; combine their efforts to eradicate the negative forces and armed groups; work together to stop the illicit exploitation and trade of natural resources; and consolidate cooperation to create economic opportunities, in particular trade facilitation and cross-border infrastructure.The United Nations and the Security Council must recognize the critical role played by regional mechanisms as building blocks in the promotion of peace, security and stability in the region, he continued.  Under the auspices of the East African Community, his country — working together with Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, and soon with the Democratic Republic of the Congo — is “razor‑focused” on improving the physical infrastructure in the region, thus greatly enhancing economic integration.  The United Nations and the African Union, as key guarantors of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region, have a unique role to play in enhancing their efforts to support the countries in the region, he said.ZÉPHYRIN MANIRATANGA (Burundi) commending all the efforts that resulted in the withdrawal of Burundi from the Security Council’s agenda, informed the 15-member organ that his country has restored peace and security and the Government, having come out of the elections in 2020, has put together a national programme towards building social stability and economic growth.  The National Development Plan of 2018‑2027 is centred on several pillars, including good governance, economic growth, youth employment, social protection, and peace and national reconciliation.  However, one of the issues in the region is a lack of funding needed to support economic development.Highlighting the clear link between peace and development, he said the negative impact of climate change on development could in turn undermine peace efforts.  Therefore, it is imperative to focus on mobilizing funding, he said, welcoming efforts by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.  He went on to congratulate the Special Envoy for his efforts towards lasting peace in the region and on his inclusive and participatory approach to elaborate the regional strategy and action plan.  He added that he hopes to see the international community support the Special Envoy in implementing the strategy.VALENTINE RUGWABIZA (Rwanda) welcomed today’s debate, which is occurring at a time when the countries of the Great Lakes region are facing the full‑blown socioeconomic impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic.  Despite these circumstances, foreign and domestic negative forces continue to operate in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Rwanda has faced several cross-border attacks from such forces — the latest of which occurred on 27 August.  She stressed that illegal trade in arms and natural resources allow these negative forces to continue to organize, recruit new combatants and obtain new equipment.For the Great Lakes region to unleash its full potential for development and prosperity, the armed groups and negative forces operating in the region must be neutralized and the materiel supply networks that fuel them must be cut, she said.  Further, increased cooperation on security and development between Member States of the Great Lakes region will make an immense contribution in this regard.  “The good news is that this is happening,” she pointed out.  Noting that cross-border trade and investment promotes confidence-building and peace, she spotlighted the upcoming Great Lakes Investment and Trade Conference, which Rwanda will host in November.For information media.

       " 'To revisit this article, select My Account, then\\xa0View saved storiesTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved storiesBy Nicolas NiarchosView Iframe URLIn June, 2014, a man began digging into the soft red earth in the back yard of his house, on the outskirts of Kolwezi, a city in the southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. As the man later told neighbors, he had intended to create a pit for a new toilet. About eight feet into the soil, his shovel hit a slab of gray rock that was streaked with black and punctuated with what looked like blobs of bright-turquoise mold. He had struck a seam of heterogenite, an ore that can be refined into cobalt, one of the elements used in lithium-ion batteries. Among other things, cobalt keeps the batteries, which power everything from cell phones to electric cars, from catching fire. As global demand for lithium-ion batteries has grown, so has the price of cobalt. The man suspected that his discovery would make him wealthy—if he could get it out of the ground before others did.Southern Congo sits atop an estimated 3.4 million metric tons of cobalt, almost half the world’s known supply. In recent decades, hundreds of thousands of Congolese have moved to the formerly remote area. Kolwezi now has more than half a million residents. Many Congolese have taken jobs at industrial mines in the region; others have become “artisanal diggers,” or creuseurs. Some creuseurs secure permits to work freelance at officially licensed pits, but many more sneak onto the sites at night or dig their own holes and tunnels, risking cave-ins and other dangers in pursuit of buried treasure.The man took some samples to one of the mineral traders who had established themselves around Kolwezi. At the time, the road into the city was lined with corrugated-iron shacks, known as comptoirs, where traders bought cobalt or copper, which is also plentiful in the region. (In the rainy season, the earth occasionally turns green, as a result of the copper oxides beneath it.) Many of the traders were Chinese, Lebanese, and Indian expats, though a few Congolese had used their mining profits to set up shops.One trader told the man that the cobalt ore he’d dug up was unusually pure. The man returned to his district, Kasulo, determined to keep his find secret. Many of Kasulo’s ten thousand residents were day laborers; Murray Hitzman, a former U.S. Geological Survey scientist who spent more than a decade travelling to southern Congo to consult on mining projects there, told me that residents were “milling about all the time,” hoping for word of fresh discoveries.Hitzman, who teaches at University College Dublin, explained that the rich deposits of cobalt and copper in the area started life around eight hundred million years ago, on the bed of a shallow ancient sea. Over time, the sedimentary rocks were buried beneath rolling hills, and salty fluid containing metals seeped into the earth, mineralizing the rocks. Today, he said, the mineral deposits are “higgledy-piggledy folded, broken upside down, back-asswards, every imaginable geometry—and predicting the location of the next buried deposit is almost impossible.”The man stopped digging in his yard. Instead, he cut through the floor of his house, which he was renting, and dug to about thirty feet, carting out ore at night. Zanga Muteba, a baker who then lived in Kasulo, told me, “All of us, at that time, we knew nothing.” But one evening he and some neighbors heard telltale clanging noises coming from the man’s house. Rushing inside, they discovered that the man had carved out a series of underground galleries, following the vein of cobalt as it meandered under his neighbors’ houses. When the man’s landlord got wind of these modifications, they had an argument, and the man fled. “He had already made a lot of money,” Muteba told me. Judging from the amount of ore the man had dug out, he had probably made more than ten thousand dollars—in Congo, a small fortune. According to the World Bank, in 2018 three-quarters of the country’s population lived on less than two dollars a day.Hundreds of people in Kasulo “began digging in their own plots,” Muteba said. The mayor warned, “You’re going to destroy the neighborhood!” But, Muteba said, “it was complicated for people to accept the mayor’s request.” Muteba had a thriving bakery and didn’t have time to dig, but most locals were desperate. In Congo, more than eighty-five per cent of people work informally, in precarious jobs that pay little, and the cost of living is remarkably high: because the country’s infrastructure has been ravaged by decades of dictatorship, civil war, and corruption, there is little agriculture, and food and other basic goods are often imported. For many Kasulo residents, the prospect of a personal cobalt mine was worth any risk.About a month after the man who discovered the cobalt vanished, the local municipality formally restricted digging for minerals in Kasulo. According to Muteba, residents implored the mayor: “We used to mine in the bush, in the forest. You stopped us. You gave all the city to big industrial companies. Now we discovered minerals in our own plots of land, which belonged to our ancestors. And now you want to stop us? No, that is not going to work.” Muteba recalled, “People started to throw rocks at the mayor, and the mayor ran away. And, when the mayor fled, the digging really started.”Odilon Kajumba Kilanga is a creuseur who has worked in the Kolwezi area for fifteen years. He grew up in southern Congo’s largest city, Lubumbashi, which is near the Zambian border, and as a teen-ager he worked odd jobs, including selling tires by the roadside. One day when he was eighteen, a friend who had moved to Kolwezi called him and urged him to join a coöperative of creuseurs which roamed from mine to mine, sharing profits. “There were good sites that you could just turn up to and work,” Kajumba said, when we met in Kolwezi.In those days, it took eight hours to get from Lubumbashi to Kolwezi by bus, on a rutted two-lane road. The thickets on either side of the highway crawled with outlaws, who occasionally hijacked vehicles using weapons they’d leased from impoverished soldiers. Once, bandits stopped a bus and ordered the passengers to strip; the hijackers took everything, even people’s underwear.Kajumba knew that the journey to Kolwezi was dangerous, but he said of the creuseurs, “If they tell you to come, you come.” At first, the work, though strenuous, was exciting; he began each shift dreaming of riches. He had some stretches of good luck, but he never made the big score that would transform his life. Now in his mid-thirties, he is a laconic man who becomes animated only when he is discussing God or his favorite soccer team, TP Mazembe. Mining no longer holds romance for him; he sees the work as a symptom of his poverty rather than as a path out of it. When you are a creuseur, he said, you are “obliged to do what you can to make ends meet,” and this necessity trumps any fears about personal safety. “To be scared, you must first have means,” he said.Kajumba joined the mining economy relatively late in life. In Kolwezi, children as young as three learn to pick out the purest ore from rock slabs. Soon enough, they are lugging ore for adult creuseurs. Teen-age boys often work perilous shifts navigating rickety shafts. Near large mines, the prostitution of women and young girls is pervasive. Other women wash raw mining material, which is often full of toxic metals and, in some cases, mildly radioactive. If a pregnant woman works with such heavy metals as cobalt, it can increase her chances of having a stillbirth or a child with birth defects. According to a recent study in The Lancet, women in southern Congo “had metal concentrations that are among the highest ever reported for pregnant women.” The study also found a strong link between fathers who worked with mining chemicals and fetal abnormalities in their children, noting that “paternal occupational mining exposure was the factor most strongly associated with birth defects.”This year, cobalt prices have jumped some forty per cent, to more than twenty dollars a pound. The lure of mineral riches in a country as poor as Congo provides irresistible temptation for politicians and officials to steal and cheat. Soldiers who have been posted to Kolwezi during periods of unrest have been known to lay down their Kalashnikovs at night and enter the mines. At a meeting of investors in 2019, Simon Tuma Waku, then the president of the Chamber of Mines in Congo, used the language of a gold rush: “Cobalt—it makes you dream.”After Kasulo’s mayor fled, many residents began tearing away at the ground beneath them. Some wealthier locals hired creuseurs to dig under their houses, with an agreement to split the profits. Two teams of creuseurs could each work twelve-hour shifts, chipping at the rock with hammers and chisels. A pastor and his congregation began digging under their church, stopping only for Sunday services.By the end of 2014, two thousand creuseurs were working in the neighborhood, with little regulation. Kajumba and his coöperative soon joined in the hunt for minerals. One man on Kajumba’s team, Yannick Mputu, remembers this period as “the good times.” He told me, “There was a lot of money, and everybody was able to make some. The minerals were close to the surface, and they could be mined without digging deep holes.”But the conditions quickly became dangerous. Not long after the mayor formally prohibited excavating for minerals, a mine shaft collapsed, killing five miners. Still, people kept digging, and by the time researchers for Amnesty International visited, less than a year after the discovery of cobalt in Kasulo, some of the holes made by creuseurs were a hundred feet deep. Once diggers reached seams of ore, they followed the mineral through the soil, often without building supports for their tunnels. As Murray Hitzman, the former U.S.G.S. scientist, pointed out, the heterogenite closest to the surface often contains the least cobalt, because of weathering. Creuseurs in Kasulo were risking their lives to obtain some of the worst ore.One of Kajumba’s teammates told me that their coöperative of six used to regularly extract two tons of raw material from a single pit in Kasulo. But most of the best sites were quickly excavated, and the yield from newer pits was less than half as much. The team was also ripped off by unscrupulous traders and corrupt officials. Kajumba said that lately he has struggled to pay his rent of twenty-five dollars a month. “Whenever we dig up a few tons, I send some money to my family,” he added.Drug and alcohol use are rampant among creuseurs. Kajumba said that, though many people he knew in Kasulo wasted all their earnings on narcotics, he avoided such temptations. Whenever I met up with him, he made a point of drinking a cola.Children who work in the mines are often drugged, in order to suppress hunger. Sister Catherine Mutindi, the founder of Good Shepherd Kolwezi, a Catholic charity that tries to stop child labor, said, “If the kids don’t make enough money, they have no food for the whole day. Some children we interviewed did not remember the last time they had a meal.”Researchers estimate that thousands of children work in mining in Kolwezi alone. Mark Canavera, a faculty member at Columbia University who focusses on child welfare, has spent time in Kolwezi. “I don’t think the government has any capacity to monitor children’s involvement in this,” he told me. “Even if it did, it doesn’t have a framework for thinking about what is child labor and what isn’t.” In such a poor region, parents often expect their children to supplement the family’s income, even if the work is dangerous.At a school run by Good Shepherd, I met Ziki, a serious boy with large dark eyes. He was fifteen but, because he had been malnourished for long periods, he looked much younger. His parents had been killed in a roadside accident when he was three; afterward, he was sent to live with his father’s sister. “My aunt sent her kids to school but sent me to the mines,” he said. “I was full of bitterness.” He joined a team of boys who roved across Kolwezi.I was initially skeptical that Ziki had begun working at such a young age, but Mutindi said that she has seen many such cases. “The younger children of four, five, six, seven, these will mainly be collecting—picking stones,” she said. “It’s amazing how they know the value.” Children are eventually given such jobs as washing ore or carrying heavy sacks of rocks to traders who loiter near the sites on motorcycles. When I visited Kolwezi, streams alongside the city’s main roads teemed with women and children washing minerals.As Ziki and his friends grew older, they began entering pits dug by creuseurs. The tunnels were square, four or five feet across, and about sixteen feet deep. It was infernally hot inside them, and oxygen was scarce. “As you were descending, there were rocks that you held on to,” he recalled. “If you held on to the wrong rock and it loosened from the wall, you would tumble into the hole. I would bump into older people who were going down into the pits, and they would tell us, ‘You children, if you enter you will die.’\\xa0”Ziki worked at mine sites around Kolwezi for eleven years. Although Congo’s government periodically claimed that it was cracking down on child labor, few adults tried to stop him from working. “Soldiers would hunt us,” he recalled. “If they caught you, they would beat you.” He went on, “If you sold your minerals, when you had money, there were street kids, thugs, who could stop you on the road and snatch your money. To pass safely, you had to pay five hundred francs”—about fifty cents—“so you could have safe passage. If you gave them nothing, they would beat you.”Copper has been mined in Congo since at least the fourth century, and the deposits were known to Portuguese slave traders from the fifteenth century onward. Cobalt is a byproduct of copper production. In 1885, Belgium’s King Leopold II claimed the country as his private property and brutally exploited it for rubber; according to “King Leopold’s Ghost,” a 1998 book by Adam Hochschild, as many as ten million Congolese were killed. But, because of local resistance and the inaccessibility of the region, large-scale commercial mining didn’t begin in the south until the twentieth century.Kolwezi was founded in 1937 by the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, a mining monopoly created by Belgian royal decree. These colonialists may not have matched the atrocities of King Leopold, but they still saw the country in starkly exploitative terms. They understood that the best way to extract Congo’s mineral wealth quickly was to create infrastructure. The company cleared the thickets of thorny acacias and\\xa0miombo trees that had grown atop Kolwezi’s rich mineral deposits and built the town across the area’s rolling hills, with wide streets and bungalows for Europeans, whose neighborhoods were segregated from those where Congolese workers lived. Locals were used to create this infrastructure, and to labor in the mines, but, as Hitzman put it, “the whites ran everything.”After independence, the southernmost province, Katanga, was viewed as a prize by Cold War powers. In the sixties, Katanga unsuccessfully tried to secede, with the support of Belgium and the Union Minière. Then, in 1978, Soviet-armed and Cuban-trained rebels seized Kolwezi and several hundred civilians were killed. Before the insurrection, the Soviet Union appeared to have been stockpiling cobalt, and, according to a report by the C.I.A., the attack set off “a round of panic buying and hoarding in the developed West.” Cobalt, the report declared, “is one of the most critical industrial metals.” Then, as now, the mineral was used in the manufacture of corrosion-resistant alloys for\\xa0aircraft engines and gas turbines.The West’s solution to the market instability was to prop up the country’s dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, who presided over an almost farcically kleptocratic regime. The country’s élite sustained themselves, in part, on the profits from the mines. Gécamines, a state-controlled mining company, ran a virtual monopoly in Katanga’s copper-and-cobalt belt, and owned swaths of the cities that had been built to house miners.By the early nineties, Mobutu and his cronies seemed to have stolen everything they could, and Congo was falling apart. As the country drifted toward civil war, the Army pillaged Gécamines, and former workers sold off minerals and machine parts in order to feed their families. In 1997, Mobutu went into exile. The disintegration of Gécamines transformed Congo’s mining landscape. Creuseurs began digging at the company’s largely abandoned sites, selling ore to foreign traders who had stayed behind after Mobutu was deposed.Congo became mired in a series of wars in which\\xa0more people were killed than in any other conflict since the Second World War. The country’s next leader, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, was assassinated, in 2001, and his son Joseph took over. Both Kabilas funded their war efforts by selling Gécamines sites to foreigners. By the time Hitzman arrived, in the mid-two-thousands, Gécamines had become a shell. “Some of the best geologists I’ve ever met in my life were still working for Gécamines, and hadn’t been paid for three years,” Hitzman said. “It was sad as hell.”Some creuseurs in Odilon Kajumba Kilanga’s collective used to work for Gécamines. Yannick Mputu, who is from Likasi, three hours east of Kolwezi, told me that he once reprocessed tailings at a company mine in his home town, adding, “When Gécamines closed, we had to go to Kolwezi.”The collective regularly sneaked into open-pit mines that are now owned by companies like the Swiss multinational Glencore. “We enter at night, we work, and leave early in the morning,” Mputu told me. He noted that creuseurs put something aside for the soldiers and the police who supposedly prohibit outsiders from entering: “We give them a percentage of our earnings, and they let us in.”In June, 2019, more than forty creuseurs were killed in a landslide after breaking into a Glencore-owned mine in Kolwezi. Kajumba and his friends were also at the site that night, but they were working a different seam. “The worst thing I’ve seen as a miner is the sheer number of dead bodies when there were cave-ins,” Kajumba said. The night after the Glencore landslide, a mining-company employee told me, “people snuck back in and continued digging.”Videos of Kasulo taken during the height of the 2014 cobalt rush show orange tarpaulins covering fresh pits and bags of minerals littering the streets. Michael Kavanagh, a journalist, visited the district a year later, and published an article in the Times observing that the profusion of holes made it look “as if it had been bombed.” At one point, after creuseurs tunnelled beneath the main road running west to Angola, the road collapsed.Kajumba and his team were part of this initial frenzy. They knew that picking at the rock beneath Kasulo’s sandy soil was treacherous, especially during the rainy season, but they were happy not to be risking arrest, as they were when they broke into the big mines. One day in December, 2014, Kajumba and other creuseurs were working a pit at Kasulo when they felt a rumble. “It was as if something was falling deep underneath us,” Kajumba recalled. They knew that, the previous day, a group of creuseurs working in a neighboring hole had asked a local chief to perform a ritual over a new area where they had been digging. Creuseurs, many of whom have little formal education and enter pits every day fearing that they might die, can be superstitious. Magic practitioners, known as féticheurs, are sometimes employed in the hope of increasing the chances that a fresh pit will contain bounties of cobalt and copper.Such rituals are often benign, but they can have a sinister side. Among the prevailing superstitions in the region is a belief that having sex with a virgin girl will enhance one’s luck in the mines. While I was in Kolwezi, Mutindi, of Good Shepherd, showed me photographs of the bruised corpse of an eight-year-old girl who had been abducted and raped by a creuseur the previous week. (The miner was later apprehended; she sent me a video of him in prison.) Children frequently die while being raped. In one case, Mutindi said, she saw the body of an eighteen-month-old infant who had been raped by a creuseur.At Kasulo, the féticheur who had performed the ritual over the neighboring pit had warned the miners not to enter it for three days, to avoid angering a dragon that, he said, lived at the bottom. The creuseurs were told that the pit would then be safe—and full of minerals. Rumors of the pit’s riches spread, and a day later some miners decided to disobey the féticheur. “Creuseurs have curiosity,” Mputu said. “They wanted to see what was down there.”After Kajumba and Mputu felt the ground shudder, they rushed to the neighboring hole. Part of the tunnel had caved in, trapping their neighbors deep below. Some fifty people vaulted into the darkness, desperate to save their friends. Rescuers nearly suffocated in the subterranean passages. Eleven of the trapped miners died, as did four rescuers.Following another series of féticheur rituals, and another period of waiting, all the bodies were pulled from the hole. Some were horrifically burned. “The last person who escaped from the pit said that he saw a huge flame,” Mputu told me. The fire’s origin was unclear, but artisanal miners can unearth pockets of flammable gas. To Mputu and his colleagues, the accident had supernatural trappings. “The cause of the flame was none other than the dragon,” he told me.Nine months after the cave-in, another group of creuseurs in Kasulo burned a tire in an underground gallery, in an attempt to crack open a stubborn rock face. Five people asphyxiated from the fumes; thirteen others were hospitalized. After the incident, Radio Okapi, a media group sponsored by the United Nations, interviewed Kolwezi’s mayor, who said that a year earlier he had sent a report to his superiors urging the closure of the artisanal pits. According to Radio Okapi, the mayor “expressed regret that no site was closed because of this request.” The report noted that more than a thousand holes had been dug in Kasulo.The Democratic Republic of the Congo was reorganized in 2015, and Kolwezi became the new capital of a region called Lualaba. The first governor of Lualaba, Richard Muyej Mangez Mans, promoted himself as Papa Solution. In Kolwezi, many benches at bus stops were painted with his nickname. In an interview with the magazine Mining and Business, Muyej spoke critically of the cobalt “contagion” in Kasulo. “A plan is needed to avoid hasty movements that could turn into a humanitarian tragedy,” he said. “We have made a project proposal that we will submit to the authorities.”The proposal, which Muyej didn’t disclose at the time, involved granting the mineral rights at Kasulo to a foreign company: Congo Dongfang International Mining, a subsidiary of Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese conglomerate that, among other things, has supplied materials for iPhone batteries. China is the world’s largest producer of lithium-ion batteries, and Huayou has made a huge investment in Congo. After acquiring mineral rights in the region, in 2015, it built two cobalt refineries. According to an internal presentation, by 2017 Huayou controlled twenty-one per cent of the global cobalt market. (A Huayou spokesperson said that Congo Dongfang followed international standards in developing Kasulo, and plans to “gradually eradicate all forms of human-rights violation with a responsible supply chain.”)China and Congo have a long history. During Leopold’s reign, Chinese workers were shipped to Congo to help build the national railroad. In the nineteen-seventies, Mobutu turned to Mao’s regime for technical collaboration on infrastructure projects. By the nineties, the Chinese were becoming the bosses: the Beijing government and myriad Chinese businesses began making heavy investments in Africa, particularly in resource-rich and regulation-poor countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Peter Zhou, a Chinese-born financier who has worked on a few mining deals in Congo, said that in such countries “there is corruption, there is lack of the rule of law, which gives you more autonomy to be entrepreneurial.” (Zhou emphasized that he hadn’t directly witnessed or engaged in corruption.) In 2007, Joseph Kabila made a six-billion-dollar infrastructure deal with China that included a provision allowing the Chinese to extract six hundred thousand tons of cobalt.The journalist Howard French, in his 2014 book, “China’s Second Continent,” writes that in Zambia, Congo’s neighbor, Chinese companies invested so extensively in copper mines that the flood of foreign money was said to be influencing elections. Beijing was blamed for increasing Africa’s debt burden, and an essay in the magazine New African accused China of “a new form of colonialism.”These days, most of the cobalt in southern Congo comes from industrial mines, which are largely owned by Chinese companies. In 2016, China Molybdenum paid the U.S. company Freeport-McMoRan $2.65 billion for a controlling stake in Tenke Fungurume, a giant copper-and-cobalt mine about two hours east of Kolwezi; three years later, China Molybdenum acquired another stake, for $1.14 billion. Zhou, who worked on the Tenke Fungurume deal, divided the current Chinese involvement in Congo into two phases. At first, he said, companies had to take significant financial risks, because “there was a lack of infrastructure—the cost base is high to transport all the materials.” They also had to pay bribes to government officials and Gécamines executives. During this phase, Chinese companies were incentivized to make money by whatever means possible. “If you conduct your business without, you know, a proper return, then you can’t justify the risk,” Zhou told me. During this period, he said, mines had few safety protections.With sufficient infrastructure in place, Zhou went on, the “Chinese are now\\xa0conducting business in a more moral way. They have to keep the people in a peaceful mind-set, so they started to build a social relationship—training locals in how to grow out their culture, their schools.” He continued, “There’s less gray conduct now, and more of a sort of transparent business.”In 2017, Chinese workers arrived in the village of Samukinda, half an hour northwest of Kasulo, and quickly constructed two dozen houses with corrugated-iron roofs. Kasulo residents were ordered to leave their neighborhood within two weeks. The Congolese government revealed that a mining permit had been granted to Congo Dongfang, which would remove the topsoil and then wall off what had once been the neighborhood. Creuseurs from an approved coöperative would be allowed to mine the site, and Congo Dongfang would become the exclusive buyer of Kasulo’s ore.Congo Dongfang offered the families of Kasulo either a lump sum for their plots—up to twenty-five hundred dollars—or a new home in Samukinda. A consortium of local organizations wrote to Governor Muyej, protesting that the evictions were illegal, but he pressed on. Muteba, the baker, told me that on a rainy day a couple of months later, employees of Congo Dongfang “came with huge trucks to crush our houses.”Around this time, Joseph Kabila announced that, after eighteen years in office, he would not run for reëlection. In January, 2019, Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo became President. The following spring, I met with Governor Muyej at his fortified compound in the center of Kolwezi. Muyej said that Tshisekedi would likely maintain the course set by Kabila—“a flight that we must take to get out of poverty.”Muyej told me that he hoped to diversify the local economy through tourism and agriculture. Mining, he said, exacerbated inequalities—“enormous mineral wealth beside a population that lives in enormous precarity.” In 2018, Forbes praised Muyej’s governorship as “a model for bringing together economic prosperity, political transparency and social impact.” Yet it’s hard to imagine Kolwezi becoming a travel destination anytime soon. On a recent trip there, I tried to visit Katebi Lodge, a new lakeside resort. At the entrance, a metal gate topped with barbed wire, I was shooed away by a police officer toting a Kalashnikov. Apparently, the lake was too polluted to allow visitors.Muyej often cited the building of a new governorate office—a gaudy structure rising above a sea of ramshackle cinder-block houses—to show how he had modernized Kolwezi. Renovations of the local soccer stadium and the town’s central roundabout, which features a statue of mine workers, were financed by mining companies.Muyej told me that he hoped to reform the mining sector, in part, by reducing child labor and by centralizing the market where traders buy cobalt, thus instilling transparency in the supply chain. Critics have called such reforms cynical bids to control and tax artisanal production for personal gain. Muyej, his family, and officials close to him have profited from the mining boom. The Governor’s son Yves is the C.E.O. of a logistics company in Kolwezi; on LinkedIn, one of his employees describes himself as the site supervisor of the Congo Dongfang mine. Muyej’s cabinet chief, Yav Katshung, is a lawyer whose firm does work for Congo Dongfang. (Katshung and Yves Muyej both declined to speak to me.)Muyej said that as many as a hundred and seventy thousand creuseurs work informally in his province. Among the forty or so sites where artisanal miners are employed as day laborers is the Congo Dongfang mine in Kasulo. Only eight hundred or so creuseurs work there, however, and that has stoked resentment. Jacques Kayembe, the president of an artisanal mining collective, told me, “Kasulo is a village that is built on mineral deposits, but not enough creuseurs can legally work on official artisanal deposits, and that’s a problem.”Whenever Muyej tried to reason with creuseurs who had sneaked onto industrial concessions, he was attacked with stones, and in 2019 there was so much unrest in Kolwezi that the military was sent in. It has become common to see soldiers carrying machine guns and rocket launchers around the city. When I first visited the area, in 2019, a toll booth outside the city was riddled with bullet holes. A local journalist travelling with me said that a policeman at the booth had recently been murdered by gangsters.Since the emergence of COVID-19, Congo’s south has endured a series of lockdowns. Kajumba said that creuseurs like him “continue to work, but the situation is difficult.” Companies have furloughed workers, adding to their frustration. Several months ago, a Congolese friend sent me a video of miners protesting for back pay at a Chinese-run mine in Kolwezi. As pandemic restrictions continued, my friend sent me footage of protesters burning tires in the streets.Last year, the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa announced that two Congolese citizens had leaked documents revealing numerous improprieties at Afriland First Bank, a Cameroon-based institution where Muyej had at least one account. Muyej, it was\\xa0revealed, had been\\xa0moving hundreds of thousands of dollars through the bank. He is now under investigation in Congo for corruption, and his vice-governor is running Lualaba. According to Radio France Internationale, the Congolese authorities have accused Muyej of not being able to justify forty per cent of his cabinet’s expenses. (A representative for Muyej said that the Governor had done nothing wrong, and welcomed an audit of his finances.)Huge sums of money continue to change hands in the region. In December, China Molybdenum paid Freeport-McMoRan half a billion dollars to acquire a controlling stake in Kisanfu, a copper-and-cobalt concession east of Kolwezi. At a recent conference sponsored by the Financial Times, Ivan Glasenberg, the C.E.O. of Glencore, said,\\xa0“China, Inc., has realized how important cobalt is.” He continued, “They’ve gone and\\xa0tied up the supply.” He warned that if Chinese companies stopped exporting batteries, this could hamper the ability of non-Chinese companies to produce electric vehicles. Last month, CATL, a Chinese conglomerate that develops and manufactures lithium-ion batteries, acquired a hundred-and-thirty-seven-million-dollar stake in the Kisanfu mine. Tesla works with the company to make its car batteries, and CATL has supplied batteries to Apple. Recently, according to witnesses at Kisanfu, a cave-in killed at least four creuseurs.In the spring of 2019, I visited the Congo Dongfang mine in Kasulo, escorted by company representatives. Signs by the gate said that children and pregnant women were forbidden to enter. Inside the compound, the land that had once been a bustling neighborhood was now a giant red crater. (I saw no children during my visit, but Kajumba told me that they still find their way in.) My minders cautioned me not to wander too close to the creuseurs, as they were liable to be violent. Not long before my arrival, a group of them had set some company trucks on fire.Kajumba said that Congolese had been employed to mediate between the creuseurs and company officials. Often, the creuseurs’ demands were not met and they went on strike. “You go in to work and say, ‘No, I won’t do anything,’\\xa0” Kajumba said. “The Chinese will feel unsafe and call in the police.” The police, he said, do the company’s bidding: “They know they will get a gift from the Chinese, so they will threaten you with teargas and batons.” Kajumba said that he had been teargassed by police at Kasulo: “Everyone ran to save his life. We felt defenseless.”At some sites, the treatment of Congolese by their Chinese bosses is reminiscent of the colonial period. In a video shared with me by Mutindi, of Good Shepherd, a Congolese guard with a Kalashnikov slung across his back beats a man who is lying, semi-naked, in mud, his arms bound. Behind the camera, a man otherwise speaking Mandarin starts yelling “Piga! ”—the Kiswahili word for “beat.” In the background are seven of the trucks that Congo Dongfang uses to transport cobalt ore.Upon my arrival at the mine, I had been given a long explanation of safety protocols, but as I approached the creuseurs it was clear that they had only rudimentary equipment. Plastic jerricans, cut roughly in half and tied to ropes, were being used to haul ore. Many creuseurs were shoeless, and I saw none wearing helmets or goggles, despite the fact that a confidential 2018 audit, by the Korean conglomerate LG Chem, had criticized the site for a lack of proper safety equipment.Some creuseurs washed ore in dirty ponds by the pits. “The Chinese are cheating us,” one of them murmured. “They’re telling us the ore is less pure than it is.” Kajumba said that he had stopped working at Kasulo six months earlier because he felt that he was being treated unfairly. “It’s as if you were working to suffer even more,” he told me.In a warehouse at the site, I watched a man, his face grim, pulverizing ore on a concrete floor as two Chinese overseers scrutinized creuseurs from behind a barrier of chicken wire. No Chinese employee interacted with me, and nobody responded when I waved in greeting.One night in Kolwezi, I went to a Chinese-run casino with a few Congolese friends. I was immediately allowed inside, but they were stopped at the door and told that they could not gamble. Black Africans, the casino’s staff explained, can’t be trusted with money. At a roulette table, a host of drunken white South Africans addressed a Congolese croupier as “Black man.”It’s unclear how many Chinese live in Congo, though estimates range from fewer than ten thousand to as many as a hundred thousand. Before the pandemic, Ethiopian Airlines’ daily flights from Addis Ababa into Lubumbashi were filled with Chinese passengers. When these workers arrive in a mining town, signs in Mandarin guide them to Chinese-run hotels, shops, and restaurants. Outside work, the Chinese rarely mingle with the locals. Very few of them know French or Kiswahili, the most commonly spoken languages of Congo’s south. In a 2017 essay, the Congolese political scientist Germain Ngoie Tshibambe wrote that many Chinese find their time in Congo lonely and difficult. “It is no paradise for migrants,” he noted.Few locals patronize Chinese restaurants, which tend to be relatively expensive and not to their taste, but Chinese health clinics have become popular. The clinics offer a rare opportunity for casual social interaction—perhaps more so than at the mines themselves. In 2011, Jean Jolly, a French journalist, reported that one of Congo Dongfang’s directors of external relations had never visited the mine that he represented, two miles away.Congolese who work at Chinese-run mines said that their supervisors were often racist. A Congolese translator who speaks Mandarin told me, “Chinese people are coming here for business to make money, so they can never be our friends.” He had overheard Chinese employers saying of the Congolese, “These people, they don’t really think.”Creuseurs around Kolwezi frequently complained to me that Chinese-owned mines had replicated the harsh conditions of China’s own mining industry. Congolese often say, “If they work without shoes there, how can they be expected to give us shoes to work here?” A Western mine official told me he had visited a mine in Congo, owned by a small Chinese company, that had many Chinese laborers. It reminded him of an internment camp: “The Chinese were barefoot, they were digging with shovels, and they couldn’t leave.”Peter Zhou, the Chinese-born financier, referred to the locals in Congo as his “Congolese brothers,” and argued that many big Chinese-run mines in the region had implemented strong safety standards. Recalling his first visit to southern Congo, Zhou said, “I wasn’t too surprised about the poverty, because I grew up in Shanxi Province, in the interior of China.” When he met with Congolese families in roughly constructed homes, he was reminded of the cinder-block rooms of his youth.Zhou acknowledged that there was “a lot of corruption” in Congo’s mining sector, but he maintained that, with\\xa0enough economic prosperity, the gray economy in Congo will fade, much as it has in China. “My Western friends come to it and say, ‘There are significant risks associated with business here,’\\xa0” he said. “I see something familiar.”During one of my visits to Kolwezi, Kajumba invited me to the cramped room that he shares with Yannick Mputu and Mputu’s brother, Trésor. I followed Kajumba down an alley in one of the town’s sprawling working-class neighborhoods. We entered a courtyard, hung with drying linens, that smelled strongly of sewage, then passed through a green doorframe covered with printed fabric.Inside, the walls were painted various bright colors. Above a bed facing an old cathode-ray television was a rack of neatly pressed suits, shirts, and jackets, many with natty checks and patterns. Even though Kajumba struggles to get by, he keeps up with the latest fashions. On the day that I visited, he was wearing an orange gingham button-down paired with a black-and-white-speckled baseball cap.Creuseurs take pride in the ingenuity required to do their job well, and some of them told me that they like the irregular working hours. But Trésor Mputu, who has two children living in Likasi, told me, “As a father, I wouldn’t accept\\xa0my son going to the mines.” Yannick nodded. “I would want, through my labors, to enable my children to go further,” he said. “I want them to be able to study in good conditions, and for them to be able to\\xa0leave the country to develop themselves.”Even if artisanal mining supports poor families in the region, it’s hard to applaud it. The lives of most creuseurs are short and marked by suffering. Many have physical and psychological injuries from mine collapses and other accidents, and from violent confrontations with the police and the Army. Ziki, the former child creuseur, recalled an incident that took place when he was about twelve: “One Friday, we were sitting down, and soldiers came into the mine—they caught us. They threw us to the ground. They sprayed us with water and then began to whip us. We began to cry and ask for mercy. And we swore to them that we would never come again to this place.”Soon afterward, Ziki left his group of friends, who had begun drinking and smoking heavily, and wandered around mine sites by himself. He began sleeping at sites, eating little and being abused by soldiers. At one point, he was taken hostage by older creuseurs who accused him of stealing their wares. In a stroke of luck, members of a CBS News crew met him while he was washing minerals. They encouraged his family to take him and his siblings out of the mines. “They asked my grandmother, ‘Aren’t these children capable of studying?’\\xa0” he said. “My grandmother promised to take us back to school.” (CBS viewers donated money for their schooling.)I asked Ziki what he thought of people who profited from cobalt mining. “I have sadness in my heart when I think of people who buy the minerals,” he said. “They make so much money, and we have to stay like this.” When I told him that Americans paid more than a thousand dollars for the latest iPhone, he replied, “It really hurts me to hear that.”The companies that use lithium-ion batteries periodically respond to public pressure about the conditions in cobalt mines by promising to clean up their supply chains and innovate their way out of the problem. There is also a financial incentive to do so: cobalt is one of a battery’s most expensive elements.Last year, Tesla pledged to use lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, which do not contain cobalt, in some of its electric cars. Huayou stock plummeted. Still, Reuters noted, “it was not clear to what extent Tesla intends to use L.F.P. batteries,” and the company “has no plans to stop” using batteries that contain cobalt. (L.F.P. batteries aren’t used in cell phones: to achieve the required voltage, the batteries would have to be doubled up, adding unacceptable bulk and heft.)After Amnesty International published a report on unethical cobalt mining, in 2016, Apple issued a statement saying that it “believes every worker in our supply chain has a right to safe,\\xa0ethical working conditions,” and that “underage labor is never tolerated.” The following year, after a report by Sky News showed that cobalt mined by children was still being used in the company’s devices, Apple suspended purchases of hand-mined cobalt, but once the media attention died down the practice continued. Huayou remains part of Apple’s supply chain.In December, 2019, attorneys from International Rights Advocates, a law firm in Washington, D.C., sued Apple, Google, Dell, Microsoft, and Tesla for involvement in the injuries or deaths of child miners. “These boys are working under Stone Age conditions for paltry wages, and at immense personal risk, to provide cobalt,” the complaint alleges. “The hundreds of billions of dollars generated by the Defendants each year would not be possible without cobalt mined in the D.R.C.”Terry Collingsworth, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, believes that the brutal conditions must have been apparent from the start. “I can’t imagine that a company like Apple would become dependent\\xa0upon a supply chain without having spent quite a bit of time on the ground,” he told me. In response, Apple said that it had been improving standards since 2014 and contended that it is “constantly working to raise the bar for ourselves, and the industry.” It also said that it had made innovations in cobalt recycling. (In August, 2020, the companies being sued jointly filed a motion to dismiss, and in October the plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition.)The outcry over working conditions has led industry players to found the Fair Cobalt Alliance, an organization that, among other things, supports small-scale mining with safety equipment and clean water. The group is now present at Kasulo and at another site. Glencore, Huayou, and Tesla have joined the alliance.Ziki, who is now in school, likes\\xa0studying and playing soccer, and administrators have given him basic supplies to take home to his family. When I asked him what he hoped for in life, he replied, “I have the hope that I can become the governor!”One Sunday morning, I met Kajumba and Trésor Mputu at the Temple Évangélique de Carmel, a hangar-style megachurch in the center of Kolwezi. The sign outside proclaims that it is the “thirtieth Pentecostal community in Congo.” Kajumba and Mputu attend\\xa0services every Sunday. “When someone finds themselves in difficulties, they can come to the church, they can pray,” Kajumba said.Inside, people swayed and sang, their hands outstretched. A few congregants spoke in tongues. On a stage covered with flowers, one of the pastors declared that the church was “worth more than any enterprise.” He promised that spiritual riches awaited even his poorest parishioners.After church, Kajumba, Mputu, and I went to a local bar to watch the broadcast of a soccer match between a Malagasy team and TP Mazembe, which is passionately supported throughout the south. When Mazembe scored the first goal, Kajumba smiled. Suddenly, the television crackled, and the programming switched to another game, in Kinshasa, the nation’s capital. “They always forget us down here in the south,” someone\\xa0said. Kajumba sighed and said that he should probably head home.One day, driving north out of Kolwezi, I noticed how deeply faith permeated everything around me: the Mount Carmel health clinic, the Salon Apocalypse hairdresser, the Light of God tire shop. Eventually, the road became unpaved. Trucks carrying sulfuric acid threw up plumes of dust as they trundled toward factories where raw minerals are processed.I turned onto a side road and crossed a creek where men, women, and children were washing cobalt ore. On the other side lay a cluster of mud-brick houses. This was Samukinda, the village where new houses had been built for the exiled residents of Kasulo.The sun was punishingly hot that day, and I was grateful when Nama Mavu, the local chief, invited me into her home for a chat. “My ancestors came from Angola, and they set up the village in 1941,” she said. On her parlor wall there was an image of Jesus, and a poster advertising a copper-and-cobalt mine. “My ancestors came here to build the railroad, and, when the construction of the railroad finished, they stayed.”For years, the villagers farmed the surrounding bush, growing large crops of manioc, but about a decade ago the land became polluted after some foreign businessmen opened a cobalt-processing plant nearby. This left no source of employment for the villagers, except as low-paid day laborers. In 2018, the residents of Kasulo who had been displaced by the\\xa0Congo Dongfang mine began to arrive.As I walked through the village, children laughed and pointed at me, shouting “Chinese! Chinese!” Mavu said that the villagers were seldom visited by foreigners, even though their factories and mines now surrounded the town. She assigned two young men to escort me to the houses that Congo Dongfang had built. A row of modern-looking white buildings rose in the distance. As they came into focus, it was clear that their construction was slapdash.Few of the homes were even occupied, as most of the original residents of Kasulo had accepted money instead. Those families who had chosen to take a house had been shown a brochure with beautiful pictures. But the homes turned out to have no electricity or bathrooms. The roofs leaked, and the well at the corner of the development was dry. Most of the families moved away.Muteba, the baker, was one of the few arrivals from Kasulo who had remained in Samukinda. Now in his seventies and retired, he wore a soiled lab coat over his emaciated body. He welcomed me into his house, which was stifling hot. The roof was only roughly attached to the walls. He had dug himself a lavatory pit, which was covered with a board. “The water here, it’s not good,” he said. “The smell of acid and pollutants comes out of any hole we try to dig for water.”Muteba, who was ill with diarrhea, wistfully recalled his home in Kasulo. “It was a big parcel of land,” he said. “It had at least fifteen trees—avocado trees, mango trees. All this was mine.” He continued, “We were chased out of our homes like animals, and now we suffer like strangers.”Mavu told me that her village can hardly support its own inhabitants, much less the new ones from Kasulo. She has no means of transport, and Governor Muyej has refused to come and see her in order to take stock of the village’s problems. She asked me to change about twenty dollars’ worth of Zambian money that she had carefully folded away after making a trade with food importers. There is no school at Samukinda, and the nearest shops are miles away.During my meeting with Governor Muyej, I raised some of the complaints I had heard at Samukinda. He insisted that I had “a bad comprehension of the issues.” He promised to address the dry well and the poor housing construction. When I returned to the village, five\\xa0months later, Mavu told me that Papa Solution still hadn’t sent anyone: “All that has changed is that I am older.”At the end of my first visit to Samukinda, I noticed mining tailings spread across a path. The residents had put them there to check erosion during the rainy season. I wondered if the tailings contained any cobalt, and a young villager told me that they probably did—after all, the entire region rested on mineral deposits. I then asked him if the residents of Samukinda had considered digging beneath the village. The young man shrugged and said that the people in his village didn’t want to suffer the same fate as those in Kasulo. Then he made a prediction: “In the end, they will come and kick us out of here.”\\xa0♦By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.SectionsMore© 2021 Condé Nast.

       " 'Translations:Photo: i_am_zews on ShutterstockBy Paul Banoba, Africa Regional Advisor at Transparency InternationalJacob Zuma, former South African president, is currently sitting behind bars in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Facing corruption charges, Zuma defied court instructions to testify as part of the state capture inquiry, triggering a 15-month prison sentence.Zuma is one of the few African heads of state to have faced corruption charges in their own country. His resignation in 2018 and subsequent investigations are the victory of the people of South Africa, powered by civil society, courageous media and vigilant courts. The events unfolding in South Africa therefore contain lessons for the whole region. Corruption, especially high-level and grand corruption, has been a significant barrier to democratic governance, human rights protection and sustainable development across Africa. Recognising this threat, on this day 18 years ago, the African Union adopted the African Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption (AUCPCC) in Maputo, Mozambique. Since 2017, countries across the region have marked 11 July as the annual African Anti-Corruption Day. Transparency International’s 28 national chapters in Central, East, North, West and Southern Africa commemorate the fifth African Anti-Corruption Day with a call to action to the governments and the African Union. Read the letter in French | Read the letter in ArabicJudging by the anti-corruption commitments of the African Union, governments across the region appear keen to address corruption. So far, 44 out of 55 African countries have ratified the AUCPCC. As required by the Convention, countries have established national anti-corruption laws and institutions. Almost every country now has a dedicated government agency responsible for fighting against corruption. Furthermore, many countries have specialised agencies for specific anti-corruption areas like financial intelligence to address money laundering and illicit flows; integrity agencies to address conflict of interest and illicit enrichment, among others. Corruption, however, appears unmoved and Africa remains as the region most burdened with it. Unscrupulous public officials across the region have been exposed as the easy targets of multinational companies – like Glencore, Odebrecht and Semlex – that resort to bribery in exchange for lucrative government contracts and license deals. Further, the region continues to suffer massive outflows of its resources through illicit financial flows, reducing the ability of African governments to provide basic services to their citizens. With the little resources available, public service provision is also rife with corruption. More than one in four African citizens have to pay a bribe to access basic services.On African Anti-Corruption Day 2019, Transparency International released the tenth edition of Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Africa. The survey, conducted in partnership with Afrobarometer, revealed that more than half of all citizens surveyed in 35 African countries thought corruption is getting worse in their country. Fifty-nine per cent of people think their government is doing badly at tackling corruption.These trends have a long-term impact on Africa’s stability, and on her efforts to reduce poverty among her population. Projections indicate that Africa will keep lagging behind all other regions. The latest World Bank report on global poverty trends indicates that extreme poverty will be a predominantly African problem in the coming decade. Commemorating Africa’s fifth Anti-Corruption Day, the African Union is calling on regional economic communities and other stakeholders, including civil society and media, to support the implementation of the AUCPCC. This is a welcome development. Some of Africa\\'s regional economic communities have regional anti-corruption measures that complement and reinforce provisions of the AUCPCC. The African Anti-Corruption Day provides a good opportunity to reflect on progress so far. This reflection should involve citizens.Notably, the AUCPCC requires the countries that have ratified the convention to report annually on their progress in implementing anti-corruption measures. Transparency International recently conducted a comparative review on the implementation and enforcement of the AUCPCC. Our findings indicate that most African countries do not report on their implementation as required. Furthermore, only a few exceptions – like Ghana and Rwanda – have established dedicated processes to involve civil society in their reporting measures. Our report assesses the state of implementation of the AUCPCC in 10 countries: Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Tunisia. It focuses on four key areas of the convention: money laundering, illicit enrichment, political party funding and civil society and media. African citizens are willing and ready to contribute to the fight against corruption, provided they are safe in doing so. According to Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer – Africa 2019, 53 per cent of citizens believe that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption. In countries like Eswatini, Lesotho and the Gambia, between 65 and 71 per cent of citizens believe that their voices matter. Citizen activists, journalists and whistleblowers play a crucial role in the anti-corruption fight. They help expose weak points that require government action, and sometimes uncover evidence of corruption that requires follow-up actions from the state’s anti-corruption agencies. Given the governments’ stated commitment to anti-corruption, they should only welcome their contribution. Despite citizens’ readiness to contribute to the fight against corruption in Africa, 67 per cent of African citizens fear retaliation if they report corruption. It therefore becomes urgent that African governments address legal protections of these willing citizens, activists, journalists and whistleblowers as crucial partners in this joint fight against a common challenge. While most people in Africa feel corruption increased in their country, a majority also feel optimistic that they, as citizens, can make a difference in the fight against corruption.States should also engage with their citizens on how to contribute to solutions. The AUCPCC requires States Parties to “create an enabling environment for civil society and the media to hold governments to the highest levels of accountability in the management of public affairs.\" It further calls on States Parties to \"ensure and provide for the participation of civil society in the monitoring process of the Convention.\" Furthermore, Article 9 of the AUCPCC requires States Parties to adopt measures for citizen’s right of access to information in order to assist in the fight against corruption. To-date, half of the member states of the African Union have not enacted specific laws on the right of access to information. This substantially limits public engagement.On this African Anti-Corruption Day, governments should take the opportunity to tell their people what they are doing against corruption. Proactive publishing of relevant data on corruption can serve to inspire citizens to hold their governments to account. What measures have been taken? What are the achievements so far? Which public resources have been so far recovered in this fight? What are the amounts involved? Who was held to account? Where are they now? People need answers to meaningfully join the fight against corruption.',\n",

       " 'Request an institutional free trial for your entire organization.The Democratic Republic of Congo is potentially one of the richest countries on earth, but colonialism, slavery and corruption have turned it into one of the poorest, writes historian Dan Snow. The world\\'s bloodiest conflict since World War II is still rumbling on today. It is a war in which more than five million people have died, millions more have been driven to the brink by starvation and disease and several million women and girls have been raped. The Great War of Africa, a conflagration that has sucked in soldiers and civilians from nine nations and countless armed rebel groups, has been fought almost entirely inside the borders of one unfortunate country - the Democratic Republic of Congo.It is a place seemingly blessed with every type of mineral, yet consistently rated lowest on the UN Human Development Index, where even the more fortunate live in grinding poverty. I went to the Congo this summer to find out what it was about the country\\'s past that had delivered it into the hands of unimaginable violence and anarchy. The journey that I went on, through the Congo\\'s abusive history, while travelling across its war-torn present, was the most disturbing experience of my career. I met rape victims, rebels, bloated politicians and haunted citizens of a country that has ceased to function - people who struggle to survive in a place cursed by a past that defies description, a history that will not release them from its death-like grip. The Congo\\'s apocalyptic present is a direct product of decisions and actions taken over the past five centuries. In the late 15th Century an empire known as the Kingdom of Kongo dominated the western portion of the Congo, and bits of other modern states such as Angola. It was sophisticated, had its own aristocracy and an impressive civil service. When Portuguese traders arrived from Europe in the 1480s, they realised they had stumbled upon a land of vast natural wealth, rich in resources - particularly human flesh. The Congo was home to a seemingly inexhaustible supply of strong, disease-resistant slaves. The Portuguese quickly found this supply would be easier to tap if the interior of the continent was in a state of anarchy.They did their utmost to destroy any indigenous political force capable of curtailing their slaving or trading interests. Money and modern weapons were sent to rebels, Kongolese armies were defeated, kings were murdered, elites slaughtered and secession was encouraged. By the 1600s, the once-mighty kingdom had disintegrated into a leaderless, anarchy of mini-states locked in endemic civil war. Slaves, victims of this fighting, flowed to the coast and were carried to the Americas. About four million people were forcibly embarked at the mouth of the Congo River. English ships were at the heart of the trade. British cities and merchants grew rich on the back of Congolese resources they would never see.This first engagement with Europeans set the tone for the rest of the Congo\\'s history. Development has been stifled, government has been weak and the rule of law non-existent. This was not through any innate fault of the Congolese, but because it has been in the interests of the powerful to destroy, suppress and prevent any strong, stable, legitimate government. That would interfere - as the Kongolese had threatened to interfere before - with the easy extraction of the nation\\'s resources. The Congo has been utterly cursed by its natural wealth.The Congo is a massive country, the size of Western Europe. Limitless water, from the world\\'s second-largest river, the Congo, a benign climate and rich soil make it fertile, beneath the soil abundant deposits of copper, gold, diamonds, cobalt, uranium, coltan and oil are just some of the minerals that should make it one of the world\\'s richest countries. Instead it is the world\\'s most hopeless. The interior of the Congo was opened up in the late 19th Century by the British-born explorer Henry Morton Stanley, his dreams of free trading associations with communities he met were shattered by the infamous King of the Belgians, Leopold, who hacked out a vast private empire. The world\\'s largest supply of rubber was found at a time when bicycle and automobile tyres, and electrical insulation, had made it a vital commodity in the West. The late Victorian bicycle craze was enabled by Congolese rubber collected by slave labourers. To tap it, Congolese men were rounded up by a brutal Belgian-officered security force, their wives were interned to ensure compliance and were brutalised during their captivity. The men were then forced to go into the jungle and harvest the rubber. Disobedience or resistance was met by immediate punishment - flogging, severing of hands, and death. Millions perished. Tribal leaders capable of resisting were murdered, indigenous society decimated, proper education denied. A culture of rapacious, barbaric rule by a Belgian elite who had absolutely no interest in developing the country or population was created, and it has endured.In a move supposed to end the brutality, Belgium eventually annexed the Congo outright, but the problems in its former colony remained. Mining boomed, workers suffered in appalling conditions, producing the materials that fired industrial production in Europe and America. In World War I men on the Western Front and elsewhere did the dying, but it was Congo\\'s minerals that did the killing. The brass casings of allied shells fired at Passchendaele and the Somme were 75% Congolese copper. In World War II, the uranium for the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki came from a mine in south-east Congo. Western freedoms were defended with Congo\\'s resources while black Congolese were denied the right to vote, or form unions and political associations. They were denied anything beyond the most basic of educations. They were kept at an infantile level of development that suited the rulers and mine owners but made sure that when independence came there was no home-grown elite who could run the country. Independence in 1960 was, therefore, predictably disastrous. Bits of the vast country immediately attempted to break away, the army mutinied against its Belgian officers and within weeks the Belgian elite who ran the state evacuated leaving nobody with the skills to run the government or economy. Of 5,000 government jobs pre-independence, just three were held by Congolese and there was not a single Congolese lawyer, doctor, economist or engineer. Chaos threatened to engulf the region. The Cold War superpowers moved to prevent the other gaining the upper hand. Sucked into these rivalries, the struggling Congolese leader, Patrice Lumumba, was horrifically beaten and executed by Western-backed rebels. A military strongman, Joseph-Desire Mobutu, who had a few years before been a sergeant in the colonial police force, took over.Mobutu became a tyrant. In 1972 he changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, meaning \"the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake\".The West tolerated him as long as the minerals flowed and the Congo was kept out of the Soviet orbit. He, his family and friends bled the country of billions of dollars, a $100m palace was built in the most remote jungle at Gbadolite, an ultra-long airstrip next to it was designed to take Concorde, which was duly chartered for shopping trips to Paris.This video can not be playedDissidents were tortured or bought off, ministers stole entire budgets, government atrophied. The West allowed his regime to borrow billions, which was then stolen and today\\'s Congo is still expected to pay the bill.In 1997 an alliance of neighbouring African states, led by Rwanda - which was furious Mobutu\\'s Congo was sheltering many of those responsible for the 1994 genocide - invaded, after deciding to get rid of Mobutu. A Congolese exile, Laurent Kabila, was dredged up in East Africa to act as a figurehead. Mobutu\\'s cash-starved army imploded, its leaders, incompetent cronies of the president, abandoning their men in a mad dash to escape. Mobutu took off one last time from his jungle Versailles, his aircraft packed with valuables, his own unpaid soldiers firing at the plane as it lumbered into the air. Rwanda had effectively conquered its titanic neighbour with spectacular ease. Once installed however, Kabila, Rwanda\\'s puppet, refused to do as he was told. Again Rwanda invaded, but this time they were just halted by her erstwhile African allies who now turned on each other and plunged Congo into a terrible war. Foreign armies clashed deep inside the Congo as the paper-thin state collapsed totally and anarchy spread. Hundreds of armed groups carried out atrocities, millions died. Ethnic and linguistic differences fanned the ferocity of the violence, while control of Congo\\'s stunning natural wealth added a terrible urgency to the fighting. Forcibly conscripted child soldiers corralled armies of slaves to dig for minerals such as coltan, a key component in mobile phones, the latest obsession in the developed world, while annihilating enemy communities, raping women and driving survivors into the jungle to die of starvation and disease. A deeply flawed, partial peace was patched together a decade ago. In the far east of the Congo, there is once again a shooting war as a complex web of domestic and international rivalries see rebel groups clash with the army and the UN, while tiny community militias add to the general instability. The country has collapsed, roads no longer link the main cities, healthcare depends on aid and charity. The new regime is as grasping as its predecessors. I rode on one of the trainloads of copper that go straight from foreign-owned mines to the border, and on to the Far East, rumbling past shanty towns of displaced, poverty-stricken Congolese. The Portuguese, Belgians, Mobutu and the present government have all deliberately stifled the development of a strong state, army, judiciary and education system, because it interferes with their primary focus, making money from what lies under the Earth. The billions of pounds those minerals have generated have brought nothing but misery and death to the very people who live on top of them, while enriching a microscopic elite in the Congo and their foreign backers, and underpinning our technological revolution in the developed world. The Congo is a land far away, yet our histories are so closely linked. We have thrived from a lopsided relationship, yet we are utterly blind to it. The price of that myopia has been human suffering on an unimaginable scale. Dan Snow answered readers\\' questions on Twitter using #AskDanSnow. Here is a selection.Q: Did you ever feel in real danger?A: Shots were fired when we were on the frontline, but the biggest threat was terrible roads and bad vehiclesQ: Why go back to 1500s and ignore the devastating role of revolutionary movements in destabilizing Congo the last 50 years?A: We tried to do both. The problems of the recent past are children of the more distant history.Q: Why haven\\'t western nations shown greater interest in stabilising DRC considering its mineral wealth?A: Sadly I think leaders think it\\'s a massive, insoluble problem that they don\\'t understand in a far away land.Q: How do you see these countries getting out of this situation? A: Rwanda succeeded in massive reduction in poverty, and development of infrastructure. It requires totally different leadership.Q: I visited DRC in 2012. Why are people so unaware of the negative impact of Western Europeans (and now China too)?A: It is a blind spot for us. I just don\\'t know why. Perhaps we don\\'t like to dwell on our failures.Q: What advice do you have for businesses intending to invest in the country?A: Have impeccable local political contacts, or don\\'t even try.Q: Do you think the war in Congo is the obstacle to the country\\'s poor utilization of it natural resources?A: Warlords control access to the resources and the bigger, more responsible mining firms will not risk the investment.Q: Is poverty in such a rich nation caused by greedy Congolese leaders or post-colonial powers?A: Nationality of the rulers hasn\\'t mattered much, they\\'ve all behaved the same. The potential wealth has corrupted all of them.Q: How difficult was it to travel through the Democratic Republic of Congo?A: Exceptionally. Roads collapsed, bandits own the night, no road travel between the major cities.Q: How can we help the Congolese people to benefit from their own natural resources?A: We can pressure international players in the resources extraction industry to be more transparent.Q: If you could pick just one thing to change in Congo, what would it be?A: The rule of law. People need protection when rights are violated, to start businesses and to find out where the money goes.And finally. The Um Bongo thing. Everybody asks. Mbongo in a local language means money.

He\\xa0has been in custody since April 8 and will go on trial on Monday with two other defendants, a Lebanese businessman and another presidential official.The 61-year-old, who made a pact to back Tshisekedi in a 2018 election on the expectation of succeeding him in 2023, denies any wrongdoing.Once a pillar of the government of former President Joseph Kabila, Kamerhe is the leader of the influential Union for the Congolese Nation. He previously served as parliamentary speaker and\\xa0has\\xa0been at the very heart of the DRC’s political life for some 20 years.His supporters charge that the case is politically motivated, a possible attempt to prevent him from running in the next presidential election. Kamerhe’s arrest last month was met with protests in his hometown of Bukavu in the eastern DRC, when some 300 supporters burned tyres and blocked the road outside his party headquarters.“Never in Congo’s political history over the past two decades has such an important player on the political scene been put behind bars,” New York University’s Congo Research Group (CRG) said in an analysis.',\n",
       " 'Kamerhe, said to have been in charge of authorising public expenditure, is accused of embezzling public funds intended to finance major works under a “100-day” emergency action plan launched by Tshisekedi after he took office in January last year.The defendants have been accused of embezzling almost $49m from funds for building 4,500 prefabricated homes for poor people and allegedly siphoned off another $2m from a programme to build housing for police and the military in the capital, Kinshasa.Kamerhe, who has not stood down or been sacked since being charged, denies the allegations against him, saying all public sector contracts were “inherited” from previous governments.The trial was initially expected to be held in Kinshasa’s high court, but is now taking place in the Makala prison compound where Kamerhe has been held for more than a month.The proceedings will broadcast to the nation on television.The resource-rich DRC is one of the poorest countries in Africa.

       " 'Today marks three months since Congolese authorities detained Parfait Muhani, a 31-year-old pro-democracy activist, in Goma, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, following a complaint brought by a foundation established by the wife of Congo’s president, Felix Tshisekedi.Muhani, a member of the citizens’ movement Struggle for Change (Lutte pour le Changement, or Lucha), faces the death penalty on charges of “criminal association” for allegedly “having formed an association with the aim of discrediting people and properties,” and criminal defamation for posting a tweet denouncing embezzlement allegedly involving some of the foundation’s staff. The trial is expected to begin later this month. Congo’s death penalty has not been carried out in two decades, but Muhani could still get a life sentence.The showdown between the Denise Nyakeru Tshisekedi Foundation, founded by First Lady Denise Nyakeru Tshisekedi, and Congolese activists began in June, when Lucha alleged that local authorities in North Kivu’s Rutshuru territory and some of the foundation’s staff had misappropriated goods intended for people displaced by the Nyiragongo volcanic\\xa0eruption. While an official from Rutshuru and his associate were prosecuted and convicted, the foundation was not investigated.Instead, the foundation filed a complaint against Lucha members, and the authorities arrested Muhani in Goma on July 6. On August 22, the authorities arrested another Lucha activist, Ghislain Muhiwa, 31, during his wedding celebrations. And an arrest warrant has been issued against a third Lucha member, Espoir Ngalukiye.“We thought that the judiciary was [also] going to investigate those responsible [at the foundation] for the [alleged] misappropriations,” Muhiwa told us. “But it turned out differently.”Because martial law is currently in force in North Kivu, Muhani and Muhiwa will be tried before a military court, contrary to the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which says civilians should never face military trial.Muhani and Muhiwa were previously targeted for their activism. Both were detained for months in 2016 and 2018 at Goma’s prison for peacefully protesting then-President Joseph Kabila’s staying in office beyond the two-term limit.Over the past year, Human Rights Watch has documented dozens of cases involving state agents and security forces targeting activists critical of the government, including other Lucha members and whistleblowers.Prosecutors in Congo should stop responding to allegations of corruption by prosecuting those making the claims. Rather than targeting the messengers, the authorities should investigate Lucha’s allegations into misappropriation of aid and take appropriate action.Access to Services for Survivors of Gender-Based Violence in Ethiopia’s Tigray RegionViolence Against Women and Girls During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Kenya',\n",

Last week, health workers in the capital Kinshasa began a partial strike in protest at not being paid bonuses for months.“These mafia networks require kickbacks of up to 35% from structures benefiting from these funds,” Biyombo said in the letter, where he recalled a previous request for a financial audit of the response.He said that Health Minister Eteni Longondo had signed off large disbursements of funds - for ambulances, beds and other medical equipment - without seeking his deputy’s counter-signature, overriding government procurement rules.Longondo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“I am regularly under pressure to sign non-priority and unrelated financial documents,” Biyongo said. He pointed to examples including the payment of medical fees for coronavirus treatment at a hospital not designated for free care by the government.Since confirming its first case of coronavirus in March, Congo has recorded over 7,700 cases, overwhelmingly in Kinshasa. But health authorities say a shortage of test kits and widespread stigmatisation around testing mean the true number of infections is likely to be far higher.In March, Longondo’s predecessor Oly Ilunga was sentenced to five years of forced labour for embezzling more than $400,000 from Ebola response funds.Writing by Hereward Holland; Editing by Alessandra Prentice and Kevin LiffeyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Cattle-rearing groups rub up against crop-growers over access to land. In the absence of a strong state, disputes can quickly turn violent. By contrast another type of nomadism obsesses the population in Gombe, the wealthy core of Congo’s capital, Kinshasa: that of elected officials.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Few politicians are loyal to ideas or people. Instead they head for the best grazing. “The Congolese politician is the most unstable human ever to exist,” says Félix Momat Kitenge, until recently a government minister. “He will change with the breeze.” Others call it, in French, transhumance politique (political nomadism).On January 27th several hundred members of Congo’s parliament put on their metaphorical walking boots and took a hike. They left the majority political grouping, the Front Commun pour le Congo (FCC), which is affiliated with Joseph Kabila, Congo’s president until 2019. Most joined two of the largest opposition parties in supporting a new majority called the “Sacred Union” set up by Félix Tshisekedi, who has been president for the past two years. The prime minister, Sylvestre Ilunga Ilukamba, an ally of Mr Kabila’s, resigned. So did his ministers, including Mr Momat. A new government will now be appointed that will be closer to Mr Tshisekedi.Mr Tshisekedi’s ascent to the presidency, in rigged elections at the end of 2018, was unexpected. For much of his adult life he had lived in Belgium. He was given a place on the ballot largely because of the reputation of his late father, Étienne, a firebrand opposition leader who died in 2017. Electoral tallies compiled by the Catholic church suggested that Mr Tshisekedi came second, with under 20% of the vote, well behind Martin Fayulu, a charismatic anti-corruption campaigner. Yet Mr Tshisekedi, to the astonishment of many Congolese, was declared the winner, seemingly as part of a last-minute deal with the former president. The quid pro quo, allegedly, was that Mr Kabila kept control of much of the state.Yet power has steadily flowed to Mr Tshisekedi as he has appointed allies to key posts. He appears to have routed Mr Kabila more quickly and comprehensively than almost anyone predicted. “We thought it would be closer to 50/50,” says Manya Riche, a Congolese political analyst. “This totally surpassed that.”Exactly how Mr Tshisekedi achieved this is unclear. Supporters of Mr Kabila (or at least those who did not swap sides) mutter that bribery must have been involved. There are whispers that some MPs took payouts of $7,000-15,000 to join the new coalition. One leading MP who changed sides admits that although “money circulated”, people were offered much more to stay. Other MPs may simply have been unnerved enough to change their allegiance by Mr Tshisekedi’s threat to call new elections. He has also targeted allies of Mr Kabila with an anti-corruption drive. Faced with the chance of lucrative positions under Mr Tshisekedi on the one hand, and prosecution on the other, many opted to migrate to the president’s greener pastures.Mr Tshisekedi made big promises on coming to office, including providing free primary schooling, building infrastructure and reforming the electoral system. Almost none of that has happened. Most Congolese remain extremely poor. In a park near the parliament, a group of men playing backgammon with bottle tops say that jobs remain scarce. “The poor in Congo still suffer, while the rich continue to eat,” complains Eric Kayado, a petrol vendor. (“Eat”, in Congo, implies “embezzle”.)Mr Tshisekedi has long argued that Mr Kabila’s control of parliament was a problem. “The system of Mr Kabila was to block [progress],” says Jacquemain Shabani, an official in Mr Tshisekedi’s party, the UDPS. Outside the party’s offices, a crowd of his supporters argue that their president has “chased away” Mr Kabila and will now bring them the changes they hope for. “Now he can work for the people,” says Darcin Mukendi.Yet a new majority may not make reform easier. The new government will not necessarily be stable, notes Ms Riche. The president’s new allies will be competing for ministerial positions. Not every aisle-crosser will stay loyal. The economy remains weak and, for the moment, Mr Kabila retains his grip on a large part of it.Some fear that Mr Tshisekedi may end up emulating Mr Kabila, whose final years in office were characterised by grotesque corruption and the suppression of dissent. On coming to office Mr Tshisekedi released political prisoners and promised freedom of the press. Now he appears to be backtracking. On January 28th Human Rights Watch, a watchdog, accused Mr Tshisekedi’s government of having arbitrarily detained and prosecuted journalists and activists. It is too early to conclude that the new boss is the same as the old boss.

       " 'Translations:Graffiti in Johannesburg for International Anti-Corruption Day 2020. (Image: Saint Nic Media / Corruption Watch) With an average score of 32, Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest performing region on the CPI, showing little improvement from previous years and underscoring a need for urgent action.  With a score of 66, the Seychelles consistently earns top marks in the region, followed by Botswana (60) and Cabo Verde (58). At the bottom of the index are Sudan (16), Somalia (12) and South Sudan (12). Across the region, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights structural gaps in national health care systems, corruption risks associated with public procurement and the misappropriation of emergency funds. The economic shock of the pandemic led to protests and dissent in many countries, including South Africa (44), Angola (27) and Zimbabwe (24), about rising costs of living, corruption and the widespread misuse of emergency funds. In South Africa, an audit of COVID-19 expenditures revealed overpricing, fraud and corruption. In Nigeria (25), civil society organisations denounced reports of hoarding of COVID-19 medications by states and called on anti-corruption institutions to investigate the allegations.  More generally, bribery continues to impede access to basic services. In 2019, the Global Corruption Barometer – Africa revealed that more than one out of four people – or approximately 130 million citizens in the 35 African countries surveyed – paid a bribe to access essential public services, like health care. Unless these corruption challenges are addressed, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa risk missing their Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets come 2030. The region is already experiencing an alarming rise in extreme poverty, undermining the progress of recent decades. Institutions charged with providing basic public services should be more transparent and accountable in their operations. Improved policies and mechanisms are needed to allow citizens to access public information, demand accountability and safely report corruption. Scoring 36 on the CPI, Côte d’Ivoire has significantly improved, by nine points since 2013. However, the political crisis surrounding the re-election of President Allasane Ouattara, which erupted into violence and human rights violations, risks derailing progress. With a score of 19, the Republic of Congo significantly declined by seven points since 2012. This performance is reflective of endemic corruption and impunity by the country’s political elite. The Republic of Congo has an anti-corruption framework in place, but its implementation remains weak. To reverse the region’s position as the worst performing on the CPI, governments in Sub-Saharan Africa must take decisive action, particularly in those economies already weakened by the ongoing economic recession stemming from COVID-19. Rather than add pledges, countries must enforce numerous existing anti-corruption commitments, including Agenda 2063, the transformative agenda of the African Union for inclusive growth and sustainable development. These commitments can only be successfully realised if the continent is rooted in good governance, democratic values, gender equality, respect for human rights, justice and the rule of law. With a score of 30, Malawi is a significant decliner on the CPI, dropping seven points since 2012. Notorious for the “cash-gate scandal” of 2013, involving high levels of public sector corruption and misappropriation of funds, the country continues to grapple with corruption. A recent government audit revealed public sector corruption of astronomical proportions, with an estimated US$1 billion allegedly stolen by the previous government.A new government elected in June 2020 promises a fresh start, with several investigations into corruption already underway, and some key arrests made in connection with a cement import scandal. In addition, the extradition of a high-profile Malawian pastor accused of money laundering in South Africa may be another test of the country’s commitment to anti-corruption. Malawi has an opportunity to strengthen good governance and promote anti-corruption efforts to reverse the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. (Image: CC BY-SA 3.0 / MsTingak)With a score of 33, Zambia is a significant decliner on the CPI, dropping five points since 2013. Corruption is endemic in Zambia and affects people’s access to essential public services. According to our 2019 report, nearly one in five Zambian citizens paid bribes to receive services like health care or education. The mounting levels of corruption may be attributable to weaknesses in the national public procurement system, operating against a backdrop of rising foreign debt and high levels of poverty. Stronger commitment to procurement reforms and open civic spaces will support greater transparency and accountability, but the upcoming general election will ultimately determine whether corruption will be a priority in the coming years. In Zambia, commitment to procurement reforms will support greater transparency and accountability.

       " '8873RD MEETING (AM)  Kinshasa’s Delegate Says ‘State of Siege’ Will Be Lifted When Conditions Improve Noting the ongoing security challenges in several provinces, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo today called on the Security Council to continue providing its “full backing” to the United Nations peacekeeping mission in that country.Bintou Keita, who also heads the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), briefed the 15‑member Council on the contents of the Secretary‑General’s latest report on the situation.  She was joined by Abdou Abarry (Niger), Chair of Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who reported on the sanctions regime’s recent activities.Outlining some elements of a proposed MONUSCO transition plan — which lays out benchmarks for the Mission’s drawdown and eventual exit — Ms. Keita said the plan was jointly developed by the United Nations and the Congolese authorities.  Describing it as a “roadmap that can help guide the work of the Mission in the coming years and prepare the ground for its orderly and responsible withdrawal”, she nevertheless cautioned that the plan must not obscure the work that remains to silence the guns in the east, foster the political dialogue necessary to pave the way for credible and transparent elections in 2023 and support the long‑term strengthening of the country’s institutions.  Therefore, MONUSCO still needs the Council’s full support, including its endorsement of the transition plan with adequate financial resources.Nelly Godelieve Madieka Mbangu, Coordinator of the civil society group Sauti y’a Mama Mukongomani/Voice of Congolese Women, remarked that the state of siege recently declared by President Félix Tshisekedi in North Kivu and Ituri provinces allowed MONUSCO and the State armed forces to defeat militant groups and restore State authority in some areas.  The goal, however, is to eradicate all armed groups.  She urged the Council to help strengthen MONUSCO’s rapid reaction units to meet the security needs in the east, and to support the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.  The Council can also help restore State authority and set up an international investigative mechanism for crimes of genocide committed in the country, she said, also drawing attention to the dynamic work of Congolese women and highlighting the importance of their participation in the peace process.In the ensuing discussion, Kenya’s representative, speaking also for Niger, Tunisia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, said the transition plan must be implemented following a clear evaluation and assessment of the benchmarks achieved.  Those should include an efficient transfer of important tasks, such as early warning networks, to the host Government, and enhanced peacebuilding efforts focused on socioeconomic development towards post‑conflict reconstruction.France’s delegate emphasized that a “partnership logic must prevail”, with the Mission continuing its stabilization efforts and protecting civilians.  Noting that an improved security situation in Tanganyika province will permit MONUSCO’s withdrawal from the area in 2022, he called for a credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful process to that end.The representative of the United Kingdom stressed that the Government bears the responsibility for creating long‑term conditions for peace and for the Mission’s withdrawal.  Minimum benchmarks must be met, while MONUSCO hands over tasks to the United Nations country team and the Government against clear timelines.The Russian Federation’s delegate, noting that the national armed forces and MONUSCO have yet to curb numerous illegal militant groups, said that Moscow will carefully study the Mission’s proposed transition plan.Several speakers condemned allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by United Nations personnel in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the representative of the United States demanding greater accountability for “such predatory behaviour” and assistance to victims.The representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reiterated his request to the Council to lift restrictions on the import of military supplies and enable the State to enhance its capacity to combat armed groups.  Among other things, he also called for severe and exemplary punishment against criminal groups or multinationals who support armed groups through the illegal exploitation of minerals.Also speaking today were the representatives of Ireland, India, Norway, Mexico, China, Viet Nam and Estonia.The meeting began at 10:04 a.m. and ended at 11:53 a.m.BriefingsBINTOU KEITA, Special Representative of the Secretary‑General and Head of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), briefed the Council and presented the Secretary‑General’s latest report on the situation (document S/2021/807).  She said the primary — and undoubtedly, the biggest — challenge in the country is the security and protection of civilians in the east.  Since the declaration of a state of siege by the Government in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, MONUSCO has redoubled its efforts to support the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), the police and the judicial authorities, in order to restore State presence and authority in each of those provinces.  The Armed Forces’ intelligence‑gathering capabilities have been enhanced, and MONUSCO is providing training on military tactics and respect for the principles of human rights and humanitarian law.  The state of siege made it possible to strengthen the partnership between MONUSCO and the FARDC.  Meanwhile, all rapid reaction units are on track to be deployed by the end of October to strengthen civilian protection capacity during joint operations against armed groups.Although joint military operations resulted in the dismantling of several of the armed groups’ strongholds, she went on to state that human rights violations perpetrated by both State- and non‑State actors — particularly in the provinces of Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu — remain worrying.  Between June and August, 367 people were victims of arbitrary and extrajudicial executions, with 203 people, mostly women and children, suffering sexual violence.  The United Nations adhered to a zero‑tolerance policy for sexual exploitation and abuse and provides comprehensive assistance to victims.  Following recent allegations regarding the Ebola response, the humanitarian team in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has strengthened its systems to prevent and combat sexual exploitation and abuse, with $1.5 billion available through a common humanitarian fund.On the country’s democratic consolidation, she said that while the formation of a new Government in April provided an opportunity to advance critical reforms, the focus of political actors and civil society is shifting towards the 2023 elections.  There is still no consensus on the composition of the Independent National Electoral Commission and several members of the opposition have organized rallies to contest that body’s reform, which has already been adopted by Parliament.  Reiterating the need for an inclusive and peaceful electoral process founded on dialogue, trust and transparency, she said MONUSCO continues to pursue its good offices with actors across the political spectrum, including to advocate for increased women’s participation in the process.Beyond these challenges, she said the implementation of the MONUSCO transition plan — which was submitted to the Council in the Annex to the Secretary‑General’s report — represents a real opportunity for both the Government and the United Nations.  Operationalizing the plan, which is closely linked to the Government’s programme of action, will hinge largely on the authorities’ ability to finance their priorities and create the conditions necessary for the withdrawal of the Mission.  The Government’s 2022 budget bill emphasizing security, education, health and the acceleration of economic growth is a step in the right direction.  With view to MONUSCO’s withdrawal from Tanganyika province in June 2022, the Mission is working closely across the United Nations system to ensure the necessary support, consolidate gains and tackle the last pockets of insecurity, while incorporating lessons learned from the Mission’s withdrawal from Kasaï.Highlighting President Félix Tshisekedi’s ongoing efforts to improve the political climate in the Great Lakes region, she said the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s term at the helm of the African Union offers an opportunity to not only foster peace, stability and development, but also to consolidate the partnership between the continental body and the United Nations.  On the renewal of MONUSCO’s mandate, she noted that the joint transition plan “constitutes a roadmap that can help guide the work of the Mission in the coming years and prepare the ground for its orderly and responsible withdrawal”.  However, that must not obscure the fact that there is still much to do to silence the guns in the eastern provinces, foster the political dialogue necessary to pave the way for credible and transparent elections in 2023 and support the long‑term strengthening of the country’s institutions.  She went on to call on the Council to continue providing its full backing to MONUSCO, including by endorsing the joint transition plan with adequate financial resources and playing an active role in its operationalization.ABDOU ABARRY (Niger), briefing the Council in his capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, outlined the body’s activities since his last presentation in October 2020.  The Committee has held three in‑person meetings, in addition to four sessions held via videoconference due to the COVID‑19 pandemic.  On 3 December 2020, the Committee heard a midterm report by the coordinator of the Group of Experts and discussed its conclusions and recommendations.  On 22 January 2021, following informal consultations with the coordinator of the Group of Experts, several regional States shared their comments and observations.  He added that the Committee also heard briefings by a range of experts during the reporting period, including speakers from the United Nations Mine Action Service and the head of MONUSCO’s working group on the arms embargo.He said that, in the course of consultations held via videoconference on 20 May, the Committee heard a presentation of the final report by a coordinator of the Group of Experts, and examined its conclusions and recommendations.  During the same meeting, the Committee heard a report by the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba, on the situation of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  On 9 July, the Committee held its first in‑person meeting since the start of the pandemic, to discuss the final report and to hear comments and observations from representatives of regional States.  On the theme of resources, he said on 30 July, a meeting was held on the illicit trade in gold, tantalum and tungsten in the national and international market, with members hearing from a number of experts on that subject.He went on to note that the Committee continues to support the mechanism investigating of the murder of two former experts of the Committee, Zaida Catalán and Michael Sharp, which took place in 2017.  Several proposals were submitted by the Group of Experts to update the sanctions list on 10 August 2020, in line with Council resolution 2478 (2019).  The Committee accepted updates concerning two persons and three entities and is awaiting updates and responses from concerned Member States in that regard.  With additional information, on 2 November, the Committee accepted an update concerning an entry to the list.  He concluded by noting that a delegation of the Committee will be conducting a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo between 5 and 10 November, to gain firsthand information on the effective impact of sanctions.  The visit will also offer an opportunity to hold consultations with the Government and with representatives of MONUSCO and civil society, with the aim of ensuring the full implementation of measures set out in paragraph 30 of resolution 2360 (2017).NELLY GODELIEVE MADIEKA MBANGU, Coordinator of the civil society group Sauti y’a Mama Mukongomani/Voice of Congolese Women, said the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been the epicentre of armed conflict for decades, with women and children severely impacted.  In response, the Security Council dispatched a peacekeeping mission to the country, now the largest mission in Africa and more than 20 years old.  Despite its deployment, however, the east is still facing the same challenges, including mass displacement, rapes and sexual violence.  Noting that the perpetrators of such crimes include both State- and non‑State actors, she added that natural resources have been looted, villages have been burned and children cannot go to school.Welcoming the declared state of siege, she said some armed groups have been disbanded and State authority has been re-established in some parts of the country.  The goal is to eradicate all armed groups, she said, urging the Council to help strengthen rapid reaction units to meet the security needs in the east of the country, and to support the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.  The Council can also help restore State authority and set up an international investigative mechanism for crimes of genocide committed in the country.  Drawing attention to the dynamic work of women in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, she stressed the importance of women’s participation in the peace process and asked the Council to strengthen its support for women’s organizations.StatementsNICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) welcomed progress made in improving the security situation in recent months and expressed support for the adoption of the order on disarmament, demobilization, community reintegration and stabilization.  He also praised efforts to combat impunity and called for their continuation, and for the model of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission established in Kasaï to be expanded to other regions.  The role of women in public positions must be further strengthened, he added, while calling for better coordination between the national armed forces and MONUSCO in the country’s east and for continued action to combat and prevent the use of improvised explosive devices.  The reconfiguration of the Force Intervention Brigade ought to help improve the response to asymmetric threats, notably that of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).  On the MONUSCO transition plan, he emphasized that a “partnership logic must prevail”, with the Mission continuing its stabilization efforts and protecting civilians.  Noting that an improved security situation in Tanganyika will permit MONUSCO’s withdrawal in 2022, he called for a credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful process to that end.GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said the upcoming 2023 elections will be an important time for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and expressed regret over the increase in tensions related to the Independent Election Commission.  In that context, reform process questions must be resolved in a transparent manner.  Noting that the state of siege has been extended multiple times, she said it is impacting timely access to justice, extending pre-trial detentions and contributing to prison overcrowding.  Expressing concern over reports of pervasive sexual based violence, including by State actors, she said it is essential that humanitarian and democratic space is respected.  Nevertheless, progress continues to be made on the Women, Peace and Security agenda, with positive indications around the meaningful participation of women in political processes.  Turning to MONUSCO’s transition plan, she said its 18 identified benchmarks are comprehensive and should provide a clear and predictable roadmap for Mission’s phased withdrawal.  It is crucial, however, that there is sufficient flexibility in the Plan to allow for setbacks and unexpected challenges, and timelines and benchmarks must be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary.JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom) expressed concern about the deteriorating security and humanitarian situations, as well as rising casualties due to armed violence, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Welcoming improved operational cooperation among the relevant security stakeholders, he nevertheless voiced concern about increasing cases of former combatants being rearmed and called for the timely development of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration strategy and its implementation.  On plans for MONUSCO’s drawdown, he welcomed the transition strategy and its identified benchmarks, stressing that the Government bears the responsibility to create long-term conditions for peace and for the Mission’s withdrawal.  Minimum benchmarks must be met for a drawdown, while the MONUSCO hands over tasks to the United Nations country team and the Government against clear timelines.  He also called for enhanced coordination with the World Bank, humanitarian agencies and civil society.ANNA M. EVSTIGNEEVA (Russian Federation) said that unfortunately, the Congolese armed forces and MONUSCO peacekeepers have so far failed to curb the activities of numerous illegal armed formations, especially the ADF armed group.  Noting that her delegation will carefully study the the MONUSCO transition plan prepared by the United Nations in coordination with the Congolese authorities, she said that, in principle, it is not possible to achieve long‑term normalization solely by military means.  Work should continue to fully implement the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework agreement, she said, pointing to security cooperation in the eastern parts of the country and across the region.  The Russian Federation is a member of the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes Region and intends to actively contribute to the peace process in the country and the region.RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India) expressed hope that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and opposition parties will maintain the current positive trajectory in the run-up to the 2023 elections.  On the security front, he underscored that the primary responsibility to protect civilians lies with the Government and recalled the assertion made by President Felix Tshisekedi in his recent General Assembly address on the presence of terrorists operating under the cover in Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu and Maniema.  Welcoming the creation of a Programme for Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration and Community Stabilization, he said MONUSCO’s role is to support the Armed Forces in addressing the threat of armed groups.  Turning to MONUSCO’s transition and exit, he said the continued implementation of the security strategy at the national and provincial levels, as well as a plan of action for security sector reform, will be crucial.MONA JUUL (Norway) observed that tensions have increased between political and civil society actors regarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s electoral reforms and called on the Congolese authorities to ensure an inclusive and transparent processes in the build‑up to the 2023 elections.  Despite five months of a state of siege in Ituri and North Kivu by the Government, the security situation in the east of the country is deteriorating, she warned.  The threat posed by armed groups against civilians is particularly concerning, as is the continued high number of human rights violations and abuses — including instances of sexual and gender‑based violence.  As for MONUSCO’s transition plan, its success hinges on constructive, effective cooperation and dialogue between a range of stakeholders, including the Congolese authorities and different parts of the United Nations system, she said.LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) expressed deep concern about the continuing violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s eastern provinces, where armed groups such as “ISIS-DRC, also known as ADF” perpetrate violence daily.  In the current state of siege, better coordination with local authorities is required for MONUSCO to fulfil its robust mandate.  She welcomed MONUSCO’s exit from Kasaï province earlier in 2021 and commended the transitional justice that paved the way for a smooth drawdown, while expressing hoped for a similar withdrawal from Tanganyika in 2022.  Turning to the Joint Transition Plan, she hoped its benchmarks will be attainable.  The promotion of key governance and security sector reforms are important, with elections approaching in 2023, and the dire continuing violence in the east, she stressed.  She went on to condemn the “horrifying and unacceptable” allegations of abuse by United Nations staff — 17 of which were raised in 2021 — noting that while many implicated troops and police, a significant portion concerned civilian staff.  Such predatory behaviour must end across the United Nations system, she said, demanding greater accountability and assistance for those harmed.JUAN GÓMEZ ROBLEDO VERDUZCO (Mexico) commended progress made by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and MONUSCO in recent months, as well as the adoption of resolution 2556 (2020) which aimed to reduce the presence of MONUSCO.  However, he expressed concern over the continuing violence in Ituri and North and South Kivu in recent months, which have seen attacks by armed groups such as the Cooperative for Development of the Congo and ADF.  He called upon all actors to comply with international human rights law, and for greater efforts to fight hate speech, which increases intercommunity violence and displacement.  He went on to commend MONUSCO’s efforts through the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo and its consequent effects.DAI BING (China) welcomed the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s three‑year programme of action, stressing the importance of focusing on governance and electoral reform, which are key to national unity.  Noting the ongoing efforts toward regional security and cooperation, he urged the country and its neighbours in the Great Lakes region to continue improving relations.  Security must be addressed in a comprehensive manger, he said, welcoming President Tshisekedi’s determination — shown in his recent address to the General Assembly — to combat armed groups.  Citing the joint transition plan for MONUSCO’s drawdown and 18 benchmarks, he said that in the areas where MONUSCO has withdrawn, United Nations country teams must take follow‑up actions.  He also urged international financial institutions to increase aid to the country, while calling on the Council to heed the concerns expressed by the Congolese authorities and ensure that such sanctions do not undermine the country’s capacity‑building efforts.DINH QUY DANG (Viet Nam) noted the ongoing tensions among political and civil society actors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and underlined the critical importance of integrating women’s voice in the political process. Expressing concern over the continued deterioration of the security situation in the east of the country — especially in Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu — he strongly condemned attacks against civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian operations.  Also citing the impacts of socioeconomic hardship, displacement and COVID‑19, he stressed the utmost importance of addressing the root causes of instability.  In that regard, he welcomed the Government’s establishment and implementation of the Disarmament, Demobilization, Community Recovery and Stabilization Programme, which maps out a comprehensive strategy to combat hostile armed groups, and commended efforts to formulate a transition plan for the progressive and phased drawdown of MONUSCO.SVEN JÜRGENSON (Estonia) welcomed the maintenance of stability by the Government, as well as progress made on relations with neighboring countries. While taking note of the Government’s commitment to facilitating reforms ahead of the 2023 elections and to furthering the equitable representation of women, he underscored the importance of efforts to tackle hate speech and incitement to violence.  On the security situation, he expressed concern about the unabated “circle of violence” in Kivu and Ituri provinces, and incidents in conflict-affected areas involving armed groups and State agents, which have resulted in the killing of at least 600 civilians.  Such violence has exacerbated the humanitarian situation, he said, noting that the country ranked high in the number of internally displaced persons in Africa.  He welcomed efforts to establish a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, and called for an end to impunity and support for justice and the rule of law.MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), Council President for October, spoke in his national capacity and also on behalf of Niger, Tunisia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, commending the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the progress made in diminishing armed group activities, particularly through the declaration of the state of siege in conflict‑affected eastern provinces.  The joint offensive operations carried out by the national armed forces and MONUSCO in combatting those armed groups should be intensified.  Welcoming the establishment of a disarmament, demobilization, community reintegration and stabilization programme by the Government under its programme of action for 2021‑2023, he also acknowledged the establishment of a Contact and Coordination Group by neighbouring States and the adoption of a two‑year action plan by heads of intelligence and security services of the regional States mandated to oversee non‑military approaches towards the eradication of negative forces in the Great Lakes region.He went on to commend the efforts made by the Government, with the support of MONUSCO, to improve and strengthen its weapons and ammunitions management systems, urging the Security Council to give due consideration to the request for the removal of the notification requirement for the Government to acquire weapons.  Noting the joint transition plan for MONUSCO, he said it must be implemented following a clear evaluation and assessment of the benchmarks achieved.  Those should include an efficient transfer of important tasks, such as early warning networks, to the host Government and enhanced peacebuilding efforts focused on socioeconomic development initiatives that promote post‑conflict reconstruction.  Spotlighting the principle of subsidiarity as enshrined in the United Nations Charter, he recognized the significant role of regional organizations, namely the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region and the African Union, in supporting mediation, dialogue and promoting sustainable peace, security and development.PAUL LOSOKO EFAMBE EMPOLE (Democratic Republic of the Congo) described significant challenges faced in his country’s eastern provinces, with holdout armed groups wreaking terror and destruction.  Greater domestic, international and bilateral efforts, as well as military and non‑military solutions, are required to address them, he said, recalling that President Tshisekedi recently declared a state of siege in two provinces in order to stamp out those negative forces.  The strengthened military presence has been bolstered by joint military operations with MONUSCO, he said, adding that the siege will be lifted once the circumstances that led to its imposition are reversed.  He went on to outline measures taken to normalize peace, security and economic cooperation with neighboring countries, including the signing of protocol agreements to tackle terrorism and foster cross‑border trade with Uganda, cooperation agreements to tackle tax evasion with Rwanda and a railway line connecting Kindu in the Democratic Republic of Congo with Gitega in Burundi.Noting that the state of siege led to voluntary weapon surrenders by various warlords and armed groups, he said the President signed two recent ordinances establishing a Disarmament, Demobilization, Community Recovery and Stabilization Programme and appointed its members.  The implementation of such operations pose significant security and financial challenges, for which the support of donors and other partners is crucial.  Turning to the political situation, he said efforts are under way to hold elections in 2023, including through the reform of a law to strengthen the operations of the Independent National Election Commission, as well as continued support to transitional justice mechanisms and the establishment of an anti‑corruption agency.  He recalled his request to the sanctions committee to lift prenotification measures for the import of military supplies and called for severe and exemplary punishment against criminal groups or multinationals who support armed groups through the illegal exploitation of minerals.',\n",

The sanctions were dropped by Donald Trump before being reimposed again earlier this year by the Biden administration.Cobalt supply chain expert Elisabeth Claesens, director of non-profit group Resource Matters said: “Britishvolt CEO’s claim that Glencore’s cobalt is ‘ethical’ shows that their due diligence process is likely either too narrow or too shallow.“Glencore transfers more than 2% of its Congo cobalt proceeds to Dan Gertler’s network, which is under sanction for corruption.“Glencore’s mining deals are under investigation in at least three western jurisdictions for potential financial misconduct.“Car makers should ask Britishvolt how its supplier – and now shareholder – mitigates this corruption risk.”A Glencore spokesperson said it couldn’t comment on the investigations.“Glencore is committed to operating ethically and responsibly in all aspects of its business,” they said.The United States on Wednesday, January 23, 2019, recognized Felix Tshisekedi (pictured) as the next president of DR Congo, casting aside concerns over the election as it hailed a historic peaceful transfer of power. PHOTO | JOHN WESSELS | AFPKinshasaCorruption is Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi’s latest headache following his takeover from Joseph Kabila in January last year.Last week, the President authorised the\\xa0 General Inspectorate of Finance to track down “mafia networks’ involved in the theft of public money.The Democratic Republic of Congo has been fighting Ebola and Covid-19 crises and Mr Tshisekedi says he is now dealing with “disappearing public funds”.Some economists have cited the Covid-19 pandemic in explaining the financial crisis but DR Congo has perennially been one of the most corrupt countries in Africa.The 2019 Transparency Corruption Index, for example, puts the country at position 168 out of the 198 polled across the world.HUGE BUDGETPresident Tshisekedi recently told his Council of Ministers that a number of senior officials in his government have been targeting public coffers.Last year, his national budget was $11 billion, more than double what his predecessor’s budget was in 2018 - $5.9 billion.With a 63.2 per cent rise in budgetary allocations, the President’s idea has been to put more money into infrastructure that had stalled or never existed, but corruption targeted the very money.Some of the money was to fund a project meant to improve certain amenities in the first 100 days.But then Chief of Staff Vital Kamerhe was charged with theft of $50 million meant for the project. In June, Mr Kamerhe was jailed for 20 years, although his supporters protest to date.PROSECUTIONS RAREProsecutions and convictions are rare in the DRC yet corruption allegations predate the current administrationPrime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga said “the scarcity of public resources is the result, among other things, of the ineffectiveness of the system to fight fraud and corruption resulting from an obsolete and non-computerised system, as well as the lack of a tax culture”.Officials reportedly collude to dodge taxes, overprice projects or simply work with private investors to take kickbacks.Sometimes, senior government officials register companies but claim tax exemptions even when the services offered are not included in the exemptions.They have even monetised their signatures, according to information from the General Inspectorate of Finance.“More than 40 per cent of public revenue goes to tax exemptions and reductions,” the inspectorate said in a statement.“This clearly means that most of the State's revenue is no longer collected because of the rights acquired by thousands of operators, who exclude entire operations from their contribution to the national effort.”KEY ISSUESAccording to figures from the Ministry of the Budget, the number of exemptions granted is excessive and their rationalisation will be the first problem.For example, the exempted value in the first quarter represents 45.75 per cent of the imported value. It was 43.14 per cent at the same period in 2019.As for the compensations granted, the balance to be compensated in the first quarter amounted to 188 billion Congolese francs ($96 million).Last week, President Tshisekedi ordered the inspectorate to carry out “a rigorous control of the exemptions granted and to examine conformity to the law.It will also investigate the granting of procedures and the possible connection with “mafia networks of fraud by interposed administrations”.Inspectorate head Jules Alingete says it will rapidly deploy its control network.\",\n",

REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon (* Any views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation.By Helen Clark, former New Zealand Prime Minister and Chair of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Illicit financial flows affect development for the rich and poor alike globally. The United Nations found that the people of Africa lose around £88.6 billion in illicit capital flight every year at a time when the continent faces costs of more than $200 billion just to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and governments can ill afford to see such wealth sent abroad.Regrettably, around half of this sum is estimated to relate to transactions in the extractive industries – mining, oil, and gas – where investors frequently set up complex webs of companies and use anonymous ownership arrangements to hide corrupt deals.Nor is this just a problem for Africa; low-income countries around the world are believed to lose up to a trillion dollars of revenue each year as a result of corrupt deals.Given the necessity of minerals for the energy transition, it is welcome that this issue is gaining more prominence internationally. In June 2021, G7 leaders confirmed their commitment to transparency and international action against corruption.But the countries most affected, and the industries where so much of the corruption takes place, need to be at the forefront in putting in place the reforms and systems which will shine a light on the shadowy structures often used to rob low-income countries of the means for development.Over the next five years, the initiative I chair – the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) – will work with transparency group Open Ownership to make beneficial ownership registers a reality in more countries through a Programme funded by the BHP Foundation. To date, seven resource rich countries across three continents – Mexico, Zambia, Ghana, Mongolia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the Philippines – have agreed to take part.Corporate leadership is also required. This week, a range of companies have committed to support transparency by disclosing information on the beneficial owners of companies and subsidiaries, and rigorously assess this data as they undertake due diligence on partners and suppliers.Systems for publishing contracts and information are not a guarantee against corrupt deals, but they do enable journalists, anti-corruption bodies, and prosecutors to gather evidence of malfeasance and bring it to light.One recent example is a deal concluded in the resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where businessman Dan Gertler, currently under U.S. sanctions for alleged corruption in mining deals in the DRC, was able to buy a substantial share in a major cobalt project through a chain of companies, none of which bore his name. The transaction was only identified when contracts on the project were published, providing evidence of his involvement and of the terms of the sale.Publishing and maintaining comprehensive registers of beneficial owners is a complex task, to which over 110 countries have already committed.Implementing the necessary legal reforms is one step, but robust technical approaches are also required. Data must be collected, verified, and published in a way that is easily accessible, enabling analysis such as that recently undertaken in Colombia where thousands of data points were compared to link extractive contract holders with politically exposed persons.Under the programme, expert technical teams will work alongside governments and other stakeholders in focus countries to support reforms, ensuring greater access to beneficial ownership information. Systematic disclosures of this information will enable cases of corruption and mismanagement to be more easily identified and addressed.We look forward to updating on our progress over the next few years. Beneficial ownership transparency is one of the best weapons we have to fight illicit financial flows and corruption. We are calling on every government and extractive company to commit to this agenda.If we succeed, the prize is large. It means countless billions of dollars going not into the pockets of corrupt officials or businessmen, but rather into economic and social investments to drive sustainable development.\\xa0Bleak houses: Families struggle to foot France's soaring energy billsPoor countries' debt rose 12% to record $860 bln in 2020- World BankWhy are power outages paralyzing Lebanon?Lebanon's crisis pushes mental health services to the limitOur global editorial team of about 55 journalists and more than 350 freelancers covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.Copyright © 2020 Thomson Reuters Foundation.

It passed with 367 of 377 votes.Under the DRC’s constitution, parliamentary censure requires the prime minister to step down within 24 hours.“One of my missions is to control the executive which, if it does not meet the concerns of the people, must be removed,” member of parliament and author of the no-confidence motion, Cherubin Okende, told Reuters news agency.\",\n",
       " \"Kabila’s allies, including Ilunga, boycotted the vote, saying the interim speaker of parliament did not have the constitutional authority to oversee a motion of no confidence.Tshisekedi’s new political alliance, known as the Sacred Union, is yet to be officially formed, but is likely to be comprised of more than 20 parties, giving him an overwhelming majority to pass legislation.However, political analysts say Tshisekedi may also find it difficult to juggle the diverging interests of his coalition.Tshisekedi won a controversial presidential election in December 2018 on a platform vowing to fight corruption, reduce inequalities and improve government.But he says his campaign of reform has been thwarted by Kabila’s lieutenants, who account for two-thirds of the vast 65-member coalition government.Still only 49 years old despite his 18 years in office, Kabila retains clout through allies in politics, the military and business.He took the helm of the DRC in 2001, succeeding his father, Laurent-Desire Kabila, who was assassinated by a bodyguard.The younger Kabila’s rule was fiercely criticised for corruption and poor governance.But it ended peacefully when he stepped down, in the DRC’s first-ever bloodless transition since gaining independence from Belgium in 1960.Follow Al Jazeera English:Naughty, not nice!XID: 35211979Varnish cache serverFOLLOW US:     Millions of hectares of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s lush rainforest remain under severe threat from a perfect storm of mismanagement and corruption.An array of global and local NGOs are in a tense fight to save the rainforest, which lost an area\\xa0twice the size of Luxembourg last year alone, according to Global Forest Watch.Virunga National Park, UNESCO World Heritage Site, Democratic Republic of the Congo [Photo-File]But the problems run right through DR Congo society — from the poor who rely on charcoal for fuel in a country with meager supplies of other power, to the senior officials who profit from illegal logging.“There are lawmakers and soldiers involved. They don’t pay taxes — it’s unfair competition,” says Felicien Liofo, head of a wood craftsmen’s association.Local police say soldiers simply rip apart the fences around the forest and threaten to shoot anyone who tries to stop them.Felicien Malu, a provincial environment coordinator, has roughly 1,200 workers to cover a province twice the size of Portugal.But his staff, he says, are not paid and lack even the basic tools of their trade — boats, motorcycles or pickup trucks.“We can’t organize control missions because there are many rivers to cross and unpaved roads,” he says.His predecessor in the job was suspended for embezzlement, underlining how corruption feeds the problem of deforestation.Greenpeace Africa and a coalition of eight NGOs from DRC and neighboring Congo-Brazzaville have demanded a halt to all industrial activities in the millions of hectares of peatland shared by the two countries.The ancient wetlands store huge amounts of carbon, but companies are involved in oil exploration, logging and industrial agriculture in the area.Global Witness investigated the illegal logging trade and earlier this year accused a general in the Congolese army of illegally reselling logging permits.However, DRC remains impoverished and electricity is a rare luxury, meaning that most Congolese still rely on charcoal as their main fuel supply.\\xa0The trade in charcoal — known locally as makala — is worth millions of dollars and it is attracting armed groups to the Goma area, threatening Virunga natural park, a sanctuary for endangered mountain gorillas.Kinshasa residents consume five million tonnes of wood a year, according to French research group Cirad, and increasing urbanization is just raising the pressure on the forests.On the hillsides around the capital, there are scarcely any trees left.NGOs and the government are once again trying to respond.The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is trying to minimize the impact of charcoal burning by introducing “eco makala” ovens that burn the fuel more efficiently and so use less wood.And President Felix Tshisekedi is trying to boost electricity across the country to reduce demand for wood-based fuel.He has championed hydroelectric power — and ground was broken in early October on a new dam in Goma.NGOs and locals are not convinced of the viability of the project, but Tshisekedi is adamant: “Given the current rate of population growth and our energy needs, our forests may disappear by the year 2100,” he says.Log in to leave a comment See the difference EXPLORE MOREPublished Friday, Dec. 3, 2021,  9:01 amJoin AFP's 100,000+ followers on FacebookPurchase a subscription to AFPSubscribe to AFP podcasts on iTunes and  SpotifyNews, press releases, letters to the editor: augustafreepress2@gmail.comAdvertising inquiries: freepress@ntelos.netClimate Action Alliance of the Valley Steering Committee member Earl Zimmerman brings us this latest installment of Climate and Energy News. For an\\xa0archive\\xa0of prior posts, visit the CAAV website.“All our major energy challenges are connected in complex ways both globally and nationally. Energy security, energy affordability, and the protection of the environment, the three pillars of energy policy, are inextricably linked.”—Neil Hirst,\\xa0The Energy Conundrum: Climate Change, Global Prosperity, and the Tough Decisions We Have to MakeAfter two decades of climate negotiations, we all got a\\xa0reality check\\xa0at the recently concluded COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow. The climate has already heated by 1.1°C above preindustrial levels and there is a fifty-fifty chance that global warming will exceed 1.5°C in the next two decades. It is estimated to reach 2.7°C at the end of the century. To keep global warming to the 1.5°C limit proposed at the Paris Climate Summit in 2015, we will need to halve global carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But achieving these goals requires an effort unlike any that humanity has undertaken before.The African continent is already suffering and will continue to suffer the\\xa0worst economic and social effects\\xa0of rising temperatures in the coming decades. This will especially affect children and youth, as half of Africa’s population is under the age of 20. Yet little was accomplished at the Glasgow Climate Summit to address how to compensate African countries for the damage created by centuries of fossil fuels and other emissions in rich countries. It also failed to agree on a meaningful plan to help African countries alleviate that damage while sustainably developing the capacity to meet their own rapidly growing energy demands.Using language normally applied to conventional adversaries like China and Russia, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin recently described the climate crisis as “a profoundly destabilizing force for our world.” To counter this threat the\\xa0Department of Defense\\xa0will have to mobilize its capabilities as if preparing for a major war. This will not be an easy task because the Pentagon is the nation’s leading institutional consumer of fossil fuels and the single largest institutional producer of greenhouse gases in the world. The U.S. cannot, therefore, reduce its national greenhouse gas emissions rapidly without a sustained drive by the Pentagon to\\xa0abandon carbon-based fuels\\xa0in favor of renewable energy.Experiencing a climate disaster and\\xa0living with climate change\\xa0as a constant threat on the horizon creates climate anxiety and changes how we think about our own existence. Yale psychologist Sarah Lowe advises:Following the COP26 climate summit, President Biden has submitted a treaty fighting climate\\xa0super-pollutants\\xa0for Senate approval. These hydrofluorocarbons, widely used in refrigeration and air conditioning, are hundreds of times more potent than carbon dioxide. There appears to be broad bipartisan congressional support for this effort.During his campaign, Virginia governor-elect Glenn Youngkin said that he wouldn’t have signed the\\xa0Virginia Clean Economy Act, saying it was too costly and “puts our entire energy grid at risk.” Even so, energy experts say he will find it hard to significantly weaken or slow down the law, given its ongoing support in the State Senate and the staggered board terms at two key regulatory agencies. He would not only have to contend with a Democrat-controlled Senate but also Republican legislators who favor the law and\\xa0an electorate\\xa0that broadly supports it. Furthermore, he has spoken favorably of renewable energy and has expressed support for offshore wind in Virginia.Sea level rise and more frequent intense rainstorms are putting pressure on communities in Virginia, especially in the Eastern Shore and Hampton Roads regions. Some state officials are, therefore, pushing for the creation of\\xa0a state flood board\\xa0to better coordinate and utilize more than $64 million in funds earmarked for flood protection, which Virginia has received\\xa0in 2021 from its participation in the\\xa0Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, an 11-state cap-and-invest carbon market on the East Coast of the United States.Our changing climate is playing havoc with our transportation system, buckling concrete and flooding roads. The federal Infrastructure Bill recently signed into law includes $7.3 billion for states to spend on\\xa0transportation resilience\\xa0projects. Another $1.4 billion for competitive grants would give cities and counties federal help to adapt their road networks.Climate migrants are\\xa0roiling politics\\xa0across the United States. People displaced by Hurricane Maria in 2017 have changed the political demographics of the Orlando area of Florida where the Puerto Rican population has grown by more than 12%. Less dramatically, people in low-lying areas of Virginia are moving to less flood prone areas. Of the quarter million Louisianans who fled New Orleans for Texas after Hurricane Katrina, about 40,000 stayed bringing more non-white and Democratic voters to formerly conservative precincts. And people in Boise, Idaho, are concerned about the political ramifications of migrants from California who are relocating because of drought and wildfires.Dangerous mining conditions, political gamesmanship, and corruption plague the Democratic Republic of Congo, home to the\\xa0world’s largest supply of cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars. A\\xa0Chinese company\\xa0bought two of the country’s largest cobalt deposits over the past five years while both the Obama and Trump administrations stood idly by.Norilsk, a Siberian city, which is one of the most polluted places on earth, now aims to ramp up production to sell the high-purity metals needed for batteries and other technologies of the clean energy economy. In another development, the\\xa0state of Alaska\\xa0has approved building a highway to facilitate mining for minerals used for solar panels and other green energy. The highway, which has no other purpose, will endanger a pristine Alaskan wilderness above the Arctic Circle.Ever larger offshore\\xa0wind turbines\\xa0are driving down costs, making it competitive with the costs of electricity from natural gas power plants. (Onshore wind and solar are still cheaper than all other alternatives). Another benefit is that offshore wind farms can be built close to major population centers. This is especially encouraging for states like New Jersey and Virginia, which have laws requiring the construction of offshore wind.Despite the green image, putting acres of solar panels on undeveloped land is environmentally problematic. In contrast, the benefits of installing them as\\xa0canopies on parking lots\\xa0are that they are abundant, close to customers, largely untapped for solar power generation, and on land that has already been stripped of much of its biological value. Even so, solar canopies are barely beginning to show up in our country’s endless acreage of parking lots but that is beginning to change. For instance, the Washington, D.C., Metro transit system has just contracted to build its first solar canopies at four of its rail station parking lots, with a projected capacity of 12.8 megawatts.European countries searching for a long-term and constant source of energy to complement the intermittent energy of wind and solar green sources are increasingly looking to\\xa0nuclear power\\xa0to help them reach their ambitious climate goals. France and England are looking to the next-generation technology of small modular nuclear reactors that supporters say are safe, cheap and efficient. Eastern European countries especially see such nuclear power as an alternative to their long-standing dependence on coal. Alternatively, Germany is at the head of a group of other European nations that want to defuse efforts to include more nuclear power in Europe’s green energy mix because of their concerns about safety and radioactive waste.Reductions in home energy use and residential greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved in a variety of ways, including through modifications to improve the efficiency of existing structures, and standards and building techniques that promote better energy performance in new homes. Policies that\\xa0Local Housing Solutions\\xa0proposes to achieve this include:The\\xa0sustainable industrial revolution\\xa0is just getting started but there are some promising initial developments. Heavy industries like shipping, steel and plastics contribute 40% of global carbon emissions, but have long opted out of climate action. This is starting to change. For example, electric motors consume about half of the world’s electricity. Infinitum Electric, a start-up company in Texas, is now developing a new\\xa0efficient motor design\\xa0that replaces the copper wire and laminated iron core found in conventional motors with a printed circuit board stator, making the motor smaller, lighter and much more efficient. In another promising breakthrough, the Swedish steel maker SSAB has begun developing a\\xa0fossil fuel-free steel making process\\xa0where iron ore is refined, or reduced, with green hydrogen and renewable energy. The iron is then shaped into finished steel with electric arc furnaces.Ann Arbor, Michigan has set an ambitious goal of being carbon neutral by 2030. This goal is especially audacious given that the city’s electric provider DTE Electric remains tethered to coal and natural gas. To work around that, Ann Arbor plans to set up its\\xa0own sustainable community-based electric company\\xa0which will generate renewable power, incorporate battery storage and tie homes and businesses to micro-grids.Ithaca, New York, also just made an unprecedented move to tackle its carbon footprint with the goal of being carbon neutral by 2030. Its electric grid already receives 80% of its power from renewable sources, so instead, they will focus on the full\\xa0decarbonization of city buildings\\xa0which consume 40% of the energy in the city. Because it would be impossible to fund such a huge effort with the city budget and other public funds, they have initially lined up $100 million in private financing through their private equity partner Alturus to fund the work of BlocPower, their building energy efficiency partner.Compiled by Earl Zimmerman, CAAV Steering CommitteeEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\",\n",

The report was released on Monday, a month after TNH obtained a draft.Sexual abuse and exploitation by aid workers was described as being widespread, with very few cases having been investigated because of ineffective reporting systems and perpetrators using money and influence to keep survivors and their families quiet.Parts of the final report – which comes as cash-strapped governments look to cut aid amid the COVID-19 pandemic – have been altered compared to the draft copy TNH obtained as part of a months-long investigation into aid operations in Congo, where hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid are spent annually.Read more → EXCLUSIVE: Leaked review exposes scale of aid corruption and abuse in CongoThe draft version made allegations that the selection committee of Congo’s humanitarian pooled fund – a major pot of funding run by the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, OCHA – had demanded kickbacks from national NGOs in exchange for contracts. The final version anonymises the funding mechanism, drawing attention away from the UN.Language was also changed in a section on the death of Cameroonian epidemiologist, Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, who was killed in April 2019, in an attack while working for the World Health Organization during the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo.The draft version suggested that the doctor was murdered after raising concerns about questionable practices in the response, which the authors identify in both copies as including the rental of vehicles at “exceptionally” high prices and large payments to security services for military escorts. These practices created “significant tensions” among individuals who sought to benefit from response funds, according to the review.“Attempts by some whistle-blowers to denounce certain practices have at best been stifled and at worst have resulted in death, such as the case of Dr Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung,” the draft said.But in the more vaguely worded final version, the doctor’s killers are alleged to have “targeted the Ebola response and those that represented a possibility to the reduction of circulating resources”.François Grunewald, one of the report’s authors, told TNH his team was not pressured to modify the document and explained the changes by saying they “didn’t want to create such a shock and antagonise organisations to the point of not achieving our objectives”.“We do not want our report to jeopardise humanitarian aid in a context where some actors are already seeing a diminishing level of resources due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.A well-placed source who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue said OCHA and the WHO were “unhappy” with the draft report and requested details be changed because agencies had agreed to participate on the basis that individual organisations would not be singled out.The source added that the authors had veered outside the agreed scope of the review, which was intended to identify common issues and risks affecting humanitarian organisations in Congo – not investigate particular agencies.Joseph Inganji, the head of OCHA in Congo, told TNH that the agency did not ask for the pooled fund section to be changed. He said he wrote to the authors requesting clarity on the allegations as part of the review’s agreed process and that the authors had made an independent decision.“We never asked it to be removed,” he said.The WHO did not immediately respond to questions on Wednesday.The operational review – written by independent consultants contracted by the aid consultancy firm Adam Smith International – was commissioned earlier this year by an anti-fraud taskforce created by UN agencies and aid groups in Congo after the NGO Mercy Corps discovered a large-scale fraud scheme in late 2018.Read more → EXCLUSIVE: Congo aid scam triggers sector-wide alarmAccording to an internal Mercy Corps investigation, the multi-layered aid scam – first made public after a nine-month investigation by TNH – likely affected multiple NGOs and went undetected for more than a decade, triggering sector-wide corruption concerns.The UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Congo, David McLachlan-Karr, said on Monday that the report’s recommendations would be reviewed by aid groups in Congo and a “roadmap” for future actions laid out by September.Grunewald said he and others would be running a series of remote workshops with aid organisations in the country to discuss the report’s findings.Five million people are currently displaced in Congo, which is one of the world’s longest-running humanitarian crises. Hundreds of thousands of people have been uprooted in recent months alone.pk/pd/agIt was The New Humanitarian’s investigation with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that uncovered sexual abuse by aid workers during the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of Congo and led the World Health Organization to launch an independent review and reform its practices.This demonstrates the important impact that our journalism can have.\\xa0But this won’t be the last case of aid worker sex abuse.

       " 'A top aide to Democratic Republic of Congo president, Felix Tshisekedi, has been arrested and detained on allegations of misappropriating public funds.Vital Kamerhe, the chief of staff and a coalition partner to Tshisekedi was picked up on Wednesday, questioned and subsequently detained by police in the capital Kinshasa. The president’s spokesman, Kasongo Mwema, told the media: “The president does not comment on the decisions of the justice system.”Police were forced to use tear gas to disperse Kamerhe faithful who had gathered at the public prosecutor’s office. The action was to enforce a ban on public gathering of more than 20 persons as a containment measure related to the coronavirus pandemic.Reports indicate that in his hometown of Bukavu, located in eastern Congo, protests were held outside his party headquarters as hundreds of young people burned tyres and blocked roads.Kamerhe’s arrest is seen by anti-corruption campaigners as a vindication of reports about corruption in high places within the government. But for President Tshisekedi, who took power in January 2019 campaigning to root out corruption, the development is a blow to his efforts.The police chief of the capital, Kinshasa, confirmed to Reuters that the embattled official was driven by police to the Makala prison where he is being held. Sylvano Kasongo did not disclose what specific charges Kamerhe faced.Kamerhe has, however, denied all allegations of impropriety.Kamerhe’s Union for the Congolese Nation (UNC) party announced a coalition in Nairobi with the then main opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) led by Tshisekedi. The CACH coalition won the December 2018 polls and Tshisekedi was sworn in.One of the first appointments after taking office was announcing Kamerhe as chief of staff even though many had expected him to be named Prime Minister. The leader of government position was handed to Illunga Ilunkamba, a trusted political hand, months after Tshisekedi took office.Analysts say the arrest could further weaken the coalition under whose terms Tshisekedi is expected to back a UNC candidate when next elections are held. Jason Stearns, director of the Congo Research Group at New York University says internal politicking from day one showed that the coalition was heading for breakup: “The coalition was important ahead of the elections, but ever since he was inaugurated, there have been people around Tshisekedi pushing him to get rid of Vital,” Stearns said.Domestic failures in themselves do not explain the global inequality of outcomes when it comes to vaccines.The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is taking its toll across the world, with many countries reporting higher than ever numbers of infections and hospitalisations. The good news is that in countries where vaccines are available there are overall lower mortality numbers, affirming that at a community level, vaccines are working. The bad news is that with a conspiracy of international politics, profiteering and domestic complacency, the vast majority of the world’s population remains unvaccinated. As of July 2021, only 25.3 percent of the world’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and of the 3.4 billion doses that have been administered worldwide, only one percent has been administered in low-income countries.We are free-falling into an era of unprecedented inequality, thanks in great part to the poor decisions being taken by the world’s political class. The world was already deeply unequal with poor countries carrying the lion’s share of the global disease burden with sparse resources. But despite assertions that this pandemic would be a great equaliser, it is instead turning out to be an accelerator of inequality. The wealth of the world’s billionaires grew by 45 percent or about $1.3 trillion since the first COVID-19 cases were recorded in China’s Wuhan province in December 2019, yet by United Nations estimates, global unemployment will rise to its highest levels in history with more than 200 million new cases as a direct result of the pandemic.All of which makes the current global vaccine inequality particularly threatening. Billions of lives are at risk because rich countries are standing in the way of making vaccines more freely available, threatening to compound the already exacerbating inequalities. In contrast, 69 percent of Canada’s population of 38 million has received at least one dose of the vaccine while only 65,000 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (population 89 million) have received at least one dose. Between them, United States pharmacy chains Walmart and CVS have wasted at least 180,000 doses of vaccine – more than most African countries have administered. And the COVAX initiative, designed to make global access to vaccines more equitable by coordinating countries to buy enough vaccines for 20 percent of their populations so that at least all healthcare workers in the world could be vaccinated – has run out of vaccines. COVAX was purchasing most of its vaccines from India, but the “vaccine factory of the world” has introduced export controls after being battered by the third wave of COVID-19.If countries like Haiti and Chad, which have not officially administered a single dose of any vaccine, do not quickly protect their front-line healthcare workers, the risk is not only that those people will lose their lives but that already weak healthcare systems will collapse. People have not stopped catching other diseases or needing treatment for other things just because of COVID-19, and if vulnerable countries lose a critical mass of their medical professionals, this may cause a lag that will take generations to overcome.But it did not have to be this way. Since the start of the pandemic poor countries have been making the tough policy decisions needed to keep the outbreak at bay. Strict lockdowns have kept hospitalisations low. But these public health measures have also crippled economies and led to epidemics of unemployment and hunger. Millions of migrant workers and day labourers have lost their jobs because of the often brutally enforced shutdowns but have borne the burden because the promise was that it was a temporary situation designed to hold the outbreak back until a longer-term solution was found. People are hungry, angry and frustrated but instead of working fast to make the medium-term solution that now exists more quickly available, rich countries and the pharmaceutical industries they protect are playing for profits.Certainly, the lack of vaccines in some poor countries is in part a function of their poor domestic policies. In Kenya, Cameroon and South Africa, the pandemic response has been riddled with allegations of corruption and the misappropriation of public funds. In September 2020, Kenya’s auditor general shared that the country had lost $2.3m in a procurement scandal at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) which was to oversee the purchase of PPE in the country. In South Africa, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize was put on leave in June 2021 after a scandal involving the irregular allocation of communications contracts in support of the pandemic. Tanzania and Madagascar had the misfortune of living under presidents who either denied the existence of the disease or the utility of scientific treatments.But these domestic failures in themselves do not explain the global inequality of outcomes when it comes to vaccines. First, even within Africa, these countries are outliers. The majority of African countries have no corruption scandals associated with their pandemic responses to date and instead have been faithfully, if sometimes slowly, allocating resources to the rising threat of the pandemic. For example, Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) received 600,000 doses of vaccine from COVAX. Initial uptake of the vaccine was slow owing to a great deal of public hesitancy, but despite the political uncertainty in the country created by the 2021 election, the government countered the misinformation and has to date vaccinated 850,000 people. In short, Cote D’Ivoire has used up its COVAX allocation and then some, but now there are no vaccines left to buy.More importantly, corruption in COVID-19 responses is not a uniquely African problem. In April 2021, international anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International found that one in five government contracts allocated by the UK government as part of their coronavirus response contained “one or more red flags for corruption”. And yet, just under 68 percent of adults in the UK have already been vaccinated. Indeed, according to the Lancet, the UK secured five bilateral deals for 270 million doses of vaccine against a population of 66 million, or enough for 225 percent of its population. Yet the UK also paid $98m for 27 million doses of vaccine from COVAX and in April 2021 received 500,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine through COVAX. It is not enough to simply point to corruption as the reason why African countries do not have access to vaccines.In fact, there is a global traffic jam in the vaccine supply chain, with manufacturers unable to keep up with the global demand. In large part, this is because rich Western countries broke an agreement to begin with vaccinating front-line healthcare workers around the world before opening up vaccination to the general population. At an April conference on vaccine availability in Africa, Stephane Bancel, CEO at Moderna, told attendees that he had no spare capacity – every time a box of vaccines is finished in the plant it is immediately shipped out for delivery. So what are we to infer, if, according to the company’s own website, not a single drop of Moderna vaccine has been made available in a poor country? And what will it mean now that rich countries are talking about diverting some of that capacity towards the manufacture of booster shots?COVAX was supposed to be a fairness pause, an opportunity to give all the countries in the world a fighting chance in the context of the anthems of global solidarity that were being sung during the worst of the outbreak in the West. China has promised 110 million doses of its Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines to COVAX which should help, but is not enough to bridge the gap. The third wave is already here, and with new variants that could undermine the efficacy of existing vaccines. We need a fairness pause, but in the medium term, the easiest way to ease this traffic jam would be to make it possible for more countries to make vaccines. Cuba is leading the way by making its vaccine technology more freely available. Gamaleya (the maker of the Sputnik vaccine) has also promised to share its technology with manufacturers in Argentina. This is a big part of the multi-pronged strategy that African countries – and indeed many other countries around the world, including India – are advocating for. Waiving patent rights would allow countries with manufacturing capacity to copy the formulae for the vaccines without fear of punishment.It is perfectly valid, and indeed crucial, to demand accountability from corrupt governments. Domestic activists are already doing that because we cannot let governments off the hook for the theft and the waste. But these demands will come to nought if rich countries attempt to use charity as a buffer for injustice. We cannot demand that our governments reprioritise spending towards the purchase of vaccines if there are no vaccines to buy. And we cannot save the lives that are under threat right now because of this third wave if we are only expected to wait for leftovers that are scheduled to come long after the emergency has landed.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.Follow Al Jazeera English:Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Governments scrambled to limit the transmission of Omicron, the latest strain of covid-19, which initial evidence suggests spreads faster than earlier mutations, including Delta. First identified in South Africa, Omicron has been detected in dozens of countries. The World Health Organisation warned that Omicron poses a “very high” global risk. Joe Biden said it was “a cause for concern, not a cause for panic”. The governments of Israel and Japan stopped foreigners from crossing their borders. Restrictions on travel from southern Africa were imposed by America, Britain, the European Union, South Korea and a host of other countries.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said it was time for all EU member states to discuss whether to make covid-19 vaccines mandatory. So far, only Austria has done so.Australia delayed a further easing of its border restrictions by a fortnight because of Omicron. Singapore tightened its entry procedures, but its land border with Malaysia, one of the world’s busiest crossings, was reopened to vaccinated travellers. It had been shut for 20 months.The UN issued a report on Afghanistan’s economy. It predicted that GDP will shrink by 20% within a year. Foreign aid, which had accounted for 40% of GDP, has been sharply curtailed since the Taliban’s military takeover in August. Their policy of making it hard for women to work makes the country poorer. Stopping girls from going to school will, in the long-run, have an even worse economic effect.In the Philippines an ally of the president, Rodrigo Duterte, withdrew from the presidential race. The exit of Christopher “Bong” Go leaves the government without a candidate in May’s election, though Mr Duterte’s daughter, Sara, is running for the separately elected post of vice-president. Ferdinand Marcos junior is the front-runner for president.India’s fertility rate fell below replacement level. An Indian woman can expect to have 2.0 children, down from roughly six in 1947. The country’s population is now predicted to peak a decade earlier than previously expected, at perhaps 1.6bn people in 30 years, and then to shrink.Russia and America traded angry words over Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, warned the Kremlin, which has been massing troops at the border with Ukraine, not to invade. If it does, he threatened economic sanctions rather than an American military response. A day earlier Vladimir Putin had described any deployment of NATO troops or missiles in Ukraine as “red lines” for him.The European Commission launched what it is calling its Global Gateway scheme, an attempt to rival China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative. The idea is to use EU investment guarantees to help raise as much as €300bn ($340bn) of public and private investment in the developing world. Critics say this is mostly a repackaging of various existing schemes.Talks on the future of the nuclear deal signed between Iran and six world powers resumed in Vienna. Joe Biden wants to revive the agreement, which his predecessor ditched three years ago. Western diplomats were guardedly optimistic after Iran agreed to discuss steps to come back into compliance with the deal. But international inspectors also reported that Iran was continuing its nuclear work.Back in Iran, big demonstrations rattled the regime. Riot police were deployed in the city of Isfahan, where thousands of residents protested about a lack of water. Locals say a long-running drought has been made worse by official bungling and the diversion of water to other cities.Conservationists flew 30 white rhinos from South Africa to Rwanda. It was the largest such airlift aimed at protecting the endangered animals.Uganda fired shells and launched air strikes across its border into the Democratic Republic of Congo. It hit camps used by the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel jihadist group that was behind two deadly bombings in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, in November.America’s Supreme Court heard arguments about abortion. A law in Mississippi bans most abortions after 15 weeks. It has not been enforced because the Supreme Court has held for nearly half a century that states may not ban abortion before a fetus is viable. Pro-life activists hope, and pro-choice activists fear, that the current court will reverse this ruling and return the matter to the states. If so, several states would quickly ban most abortions.America’s air-force secretary said his country was engaged in an “arms race” with China in the development of hypersonic weapons. He said this did not necessarily involve boosting their number, but rather their quality. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has said that China tested such technology this year, calling it close to a “Sputnik moment”.The Women’s Tennis Association suspended its tournaments in China. It cited uncertainty surrounding Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis star who last month accused a former deputy prime minister of sexually abusing her. The WTA worries that Ms Peng has been silenced.Xiomara Castro was declared the winner of the presidential election in Honduras. Ms Castro is from the left-wing opposition. Her win marks the first real political change for over a decade in a country riddled with corruption and organised crime. She campaigned as a moderate, though many of her allies are on the far left.Fifty-five years after gaining independence from Britain, Barbados became a republic, removing the British monarch as its head of state. At a ceremony on the Caribbean island, Prince Charles acknowledged the “appalling atrocity of slavery”.

       " 'Translations:Corruption in African countries is hindering economic, political and social development. It is a major barrier to economic growth, good governance and basic freedoms, such as freedom of speech or citizens’ right to hold governments to account.More than this, corruption affects the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities.The 10th edition of the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Africa, reveals that while most people in Africa feel corruption increased in their country, a majority also feel optimistic that they, as citizens, can make a difference in the fight against corruption.Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Africa | Transparency InternationalOur research shows that more than half of all citizens think corruption is getting worse in their country and that their government is doing a bad job in tackling corruption.The report also found more than one in four people who accessed public services, such as health care and education, paid a bribe in the previous year.This is equivalent to approximately 130 million citizens in the 35 countries surveyed. Conducted in partnership with Afrobarometer and Omega Research, the GCB is the largest, most detailed survey of citizens’ views on corruption and their direct experiences of bribery in Africa. The survey incorporates the views of more than 47,000 citizens from 35 countries across Africa.Citizens think the police is the most corrupt institution, with 47 per cent of people believing that most or all police are corrupt. These results are consistent with findings from the 2015 report.Unsurprisingly, police also consistently earn the highest bribery rate across Africa. Other public services like utilities, including electricity and water, and identification documents, including licenses and passports, also have high bribery rates.Bribery does not affect all people equally, it hits the poorest harder than the wealthiest – often denying people access to critical healthcare, education and legal protections, with devastating consequences. Young people, aged 18-34 years, are more likely to pay bribes than older people, aged over 55 years.Paying bribes for essential public services means poorer families have less money for other necessities like food, water and medicine.Governments have a long way to go in regaining citizens’ trust.Yet, despite this, African citizens think change is possible.Several countries stand out for their bribery rates and corruption levels, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mauritius. Eighty-five per cent of citizens in the DRC think corruption is getting worse, which is the highest in the region. The country also has the highest bribery rate on the continent (80 per cent of public service users), with the police earning the highest bribery rate of any country across any sector - 75 per cent of those who came into contact with the police paid a bribe.By contrast, Mauritius has one of the lowest bribery rates in the region (5 per cent), with the police also earning a low bribery rate (5 per cent). Given these positive results, it’s no surprise that more than 55 per cent of Mauritians think that reporting cases of corruption will lead to proper action.As part of our analysis, we compared citizens’ views of corruption among Members of Parliament (MPs) with other indices, like the Clean Elections Index, which measure corruption in national elections and found a direct link. Non-African actors also play a significant role in fuelling corruption in Africa through foreign bribery and money laundering. Too often, countries that export large volumes of goods and services around the world, fail to investigate and punish companies that pay bribes.In turn, political leaders make deals with foreign businesses to promote their personal interests at the expense of the citizens they serve.Tackling corruption in Africa requires a holistic, systemic approach. Some of our top recommendations to African governments include:Governments of major economies, including G20 and OECD countries, and offshore financial centres should:Business leaders around the world should implement international anti-corruption and anti-money laundering standards.Read the full report on the Global Corruption Barometer Africa 2019:  For the full list of countries surveyed and information on the survey approach, please see here.

Throughout the country and across the world, Congolese were watching the proceedings live. Kamerhe, President Felix Tshisekedi’s chief of staff, one of the most powerful political figures in Congo’s recent history and a former ally of ex-president Joseph Kabila, was found guilty of embezzlement and corruption. He is the most senior politician in Congo ever to be prosecuted on graft charges.',\n",

Throughout the proceedings, Congolese on social media denounced a system that has long been hollowed out by rampant graft, reminding authorities that the misappropriation of public funds goes beyond just one political figure.

       " 'More than one in three Africans believe there is endemic corruption in politics in their country, according to our latest survey conducted with over 47,000 respondents in 35 countries across Africa. The most concerned citizens are found in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where 79 per cent think that all or most parliamentarians are corrupt, followed by Gabon with 71 per cent. However, there are countries where citizens rate the integrity of their parliamentarians much higher. For example, in Cabo Verde and the Gambia, only 15 per cent and 16 per cent of respondents respectively think that all or most parliamentarians are involved in corruption. The survey results are based on nationally representative face-to-face interviews between September 2016 and September 2018, conducted in partnership with Afrobarometer. The survey in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was conducted by Omega Research. What accounts for such a wide disparity in peoples’ perceptions of the integrity of elected representatives in different countries? In this piece, we will to look at various forms of political corruption, how they manifest in African countries and what can be done to promote political integrity.One of the foundations of our democratic institutions is the social contract between voters and elected representatives. Politicians are entrusted with power in order to represent the interests of the general public. Political integrity means that politicians act in the public interest, rather than serving private interests. The separation of the public and private spheres is paramount in the exercise of political integrity. Politicians won’t always make decisions which align with the short-term preferences of everyone, but it does mean they act in a way which is consistent with a set of moral or ethical principles and standards. Political corruption is the manipulation of policies, institutions and rules of procedure by political decision-makers who abuse their position for private gain. This takes the form of gross conflicts of interest, where elected politicians and their families or cronies hold substantial business interests. It takes the form of abuse of state resources, such as investing in unnecessary projects right before election campaigns. It takes the form of businesses bankrolling political candidates to turn them into their clients. What all these factors have in common is the spilling over of private interests into the public sphere and decision-making.State capture occurs when corruption is so systemic within the institutions of the state that private interests substitute their own interests for the common good as the main drivers of policy and regulation.\\u202fWhen the state is captured, companies and individuals shape and affect the formulation of laws and regulations through illicit payments, such as bribes to parliamentarians and public officials. Illicit contributions during electoral campaigns, and influencing key public sector appointments are other methods that ultimately lead to\\u202fan\\u202ferosion of\\u202fpublic trust in public institutions.\\u202f In\\u202fSouth Africa, where\\u202four survey finds that 38 per cent of citizens\\u202fthink that all or most in the office of former President Zuma were corrupt, and 44 per cent believe that all or most parliamentarians are corrupt, the issue of\\u202fmoney in politics and undue influence of private interest on public policies has been a very hot topic lately. A recent inquiry\\u202fon state capture\\u202ffound that a private\\u202fcompany\\u202fwas bribing politically connected individuals and the ruling African National Congress. According to\\u202fofficial testimonies,\\u202fthe company paid monthly bribes of US$250,000 – US$400,000 to senior government officials. As Corruption Watch, our national chapter in\\u202fSouth\\u202fAfrica put it, “under the direction of the company’s CEO bribes were paid to the President and his close associates, to leading cabinet ministers and to senior officials in the National Prosecuting Authority in order to obtain multi-million Rand public contracts and to ensure their impunity.\\u202fIn the process, they not only subverted the objectives of the public procurement system thus elevating costs and undermining the quality of public services, but they also contributed to the near-destruction of the key law enforcement agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of corruption.”Conflicts of interests occur when a person is in a position to derive personal benefit from actions or decisions made in their official capacity. Such situations risk placing the private interest of the political decision-makers above the public interest. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the family of former President Kabila has partial or full ownership of over 80 companies active in sectors such as farming, mining, banking, real estate, airlines and telecoms. Most of these sectors require businesses to acquire permits and contracts from the government. Indeed, the Kabila family benefits from large permits as well as joint ventures and subcontracts that exceed the limits set in the DRC’s legal code. During Kabila’s tenure, an estimated US$4 billion went missing every year, in part due to dubious public procurement practices.A common avenue for money to enter politics, besides direct bribes paid to senior officials, is through the financing of political parties. When elected, politicians can give preferential treatment to companies or groups who bankrolled their campaigns. At the same time, when political contestants do not have to declare the sources of funding and campaign expenditure, the costs of election campaigns increase and the risk of illegal expenditure increase, such as vote buying.*The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption, ratified by 40 countries, specifically requires state parties to incorporate the principle of transparency into political party funding, and to proscribe the use of funds acquired through corruption.Despite some African countries recently initiating public debates on political finance reform (here and here), change is very slow to happen in most countries. Even when laws exist, implementation and enforcement are very poor. A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, argues that the financing of political parties in Nigeria “has served the purposes of consolidating elite rule as well as the political exclusion of the non-elite.” Our GCB survey finds that over 60 per cent of Nigerians believe that most or all of their MPs are involved in corruption.The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, our national chapter in Nigeria, argue that laundered money is often used for political campaign financing and vote-buying during elections. Election management bodies and other relevant oversight and law enforcement agencies often lack the appropriate mandate, independence and resources to ensure that laws are enforced. Civil society organisations and the media do not have the space or resources to monitor who is funding political candidates, and whether these same donors are more likely to enjoy preferential treatment once those they have funded come to power.* The 5th edition of an Afrobarometer survey found that 15% of Africans had been offered financial incentives to vote one way or another at an election.The abuse of state resources, defined as undue advantages obtained by certain parties or candidates through use of their official positions or connections to governmental institutions, to influence the outcome of elections, is a grave breach of political integrity as it gives incumbents an unfair electoral advantage (see here and here). A 2013 study on abuse of state resources in Uganda found a textbook catalogue of such abuses, including using government facilities for political purposes, money from state revenues being used for partisan purposes, a supplementary budget passed six weeks before the election included US$4.2 million for youth unemployment.In this year’s edition of the GCB, 78 per cent of Ugandans said that the government is doing badly in the fight against corruption and 69 per cent said that corruption is increasing. Almost two in five citizens in Uganda believe that most or all of their top politicians are corrupt.In 2012 Kofi Annan wrote: “Building democracy is a complex process. Elections are only a starting point but if their integrity is compromised, so is the legitimacy of democracy.”  We find that citizens tend to perceive their top politicians to be less corrupt in countries which perform well on electoral integrity, as measured for example by the Clean Elections Index.**Electoral integrity refers to the appropriate conduct of all parties involved in elections, including candidates, voters and election management authorities. In fact, expert assessments of corruption, as reflected in the Corruption Perceptions Index scores are even more closely associated with the Clean Elections Index than people’s perceptions, as seen in the GCB. This may be due to public opinion data being more volatile and sensitive to high-profile cases that receive considerable attention in the media.** The Clean Elections index is comprised of the following dimensions: Election Oversight Body autonomy and capacity, Election voter registry, Election vote buying, Election other voting irregularities, Election government intimidation, Election other electoral violence, Election free and fair. For more, please consult the V-Dem codebook.One of the best performers in this edition of the GCB is the small West African state of Gambia. The majority of Gambians (54 per cent) said that the government is doing a good job in the fight against corruption. Sixty-seven per cent of them said that they trust the president “somewhat” or “a lot”. Members of the Parliament also enjoy a high integrity rating, with only 15 per cent of Gambians thinking that they are involved in corruption (less than half the average for Africa, 36 per cent).Since the ousting of autocratic ruler Yahya Jammeh, Gambia has improved markedly across different governance indicators, including an upgrade from “Not Free” to “Partly Free” in the Freedom House ratings as well as an improvement from “repressed” to “obstructed” in the CIVICUS assessment of civic space and notably a 40 per cent improvement on the Clean Elections Index score. All these changes followed the 2016 elections, deemed peaceful and credible by international observers.After 22 years of patrimonial rule, where the misuse of state resources was normal, Gambians seem to have placed their trust on their new democratically elected representatives, who have vowed to uphold political integrity and deliver results for ordinary citizens. Gambians have taken a great leap towards democratic consolidation, however much more work is needed to ensure that transparency and accountability follow the political opening. Despite recent improvements and an apparent commitment to transparency and accountability by the current president Adama Burrow, political integrity remains a key challenge in Gambia.Although ministers in the new government were supposed to disclose their assets by July 2017, as of yet many of them have failed to do so. Worryingly, the reform-minded president’s family where involved in a controversy when his wife’s foundation was found to have accepted a donation of US$752,594.42 by a company competing for a government tender on electricity distribution. The matter is being investigated, and the way it is handled will show whether Gambia is truly committed to political integrity, or whether vested private interest will continue to dominate politics.Crucially, political corruption excludes and disenfranchises large swathes of the population, particularly those who are less well connected and powerful. Across Africa, only 41 per cent of citizens are satisfied with how democracy works in their country. Worryingly, those living in high poverty are more than 15 percentage points more likely to say that most or all politicians are involved in corruption, as compared to the richest respondents.Corruption erodes citizen trust in democratic institutions and leads to political apathy, which in turn further fuels corruption. Open, fair and accountable access to decision-making is essential to regain citizen’s trust in democracy, and to ensure policies meet people’s needs.',\n",

It is winding down now, with no new cases recorded in over a month.President Felix Tshisekedi stripped him of his role managing the Ebola response last July and he resigned from the government days later, criticizing actions taken by Tshisekedi. He was arrested in September.Ilunga’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday, but they have previously denied all the allegations.The court convicted Ilunga and his financial advisor of forging receipts worth $391,332 from a fake company, referred to as New Sarah pharmaceutical depot, to justify purchases of products already paid for by international donors.The pair diverted a further $13,000 intended to pay for transport of life-saving goods to Ebola hotspots, the court found.The judgment marks the first time a minister from former President Joseph Kabila’s government has been convicted for corruption since Tshisekedi took power last year. Ilunga was nominated by Kabila but remained in his post for months while negotiations about Tshiskedi’s first cabinet dragged out.Having run on an anti-courruption ticket, Tshisekdi’s declared ambitions to clean up public finances have been hampered by an awkward power-sharing deal with Kabila, whose allies control a majority of ministries and seats in parliament.The hundreds of millions of dollars pumped by foreign donors into the response to Congo’s Ebola outbreak, the second deadliest ever, raised fears of corruption after the response to West Africa’s even larger 2013-16 outbreak was dogged by allegations of graft.Reporting by Stanys Bujakera, writing by Hereward Holland; Editing by Aaron Ross and Angus MacSwanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

       " 'ΔThe Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is now under new management. In April, President Felix Tshisekedi ousted the last remaining elements of his government who were loyal to former leader Joseph Kabila in the culmination of a long campaign to take full control of the country. It was a secret power-sharing deal with Kabila that initially brought Tshisekedi to power, naming him the winner of the rigged 2018 elections over Martin Fayulu, who was widely-acknowledged as the true victor of the popular vote. Now, more than two years into his tenure, Tshisekedi has thrown off the vestiges of the Kabila “puppet master” and is poised to pursue his own political agenda. \\xa0Tshisekedi seems poised to make regional integration a cornerstone of his independent administration, throwing off the country’s moniker as “Africa’s problem child” to build closer political and economic ties with other states in the region. Not only have such efforts gained traction on the continent in recent years, but Tshisekedi is also keen to distance himself from the foreign policy of his predecessor, emphasizing his own multilateral ambitions in contrast to Kabila’s “brinksmanship” approach to diplomacy. But while Tshisekedi has touted regional cooperation as a key priority, his wholesale campaign to discredit political opponents suggests that he has not fully set aside the authoritarian tactics favored by Kabila.Tshisekedi’s ties to “the Congo strongman” have hurt him from the start of his administration. He initially campaigned against endemic political issues, with promises to curb rampant corruption, raising average wages, and resolve instability in eastern DRC. This reform-minded agenda was explicitly presented as a foil to Kabila, who has been widely-condemned in the country as a leader willing to ignore crises to secure his own political power. But the power-sharing deal that brought him into office unexpectedly put Tshisekedi in the position of working with Kabila, not against him. The perceived power struggle between the two men sparked national outrage the new president spent his first two years in office on political squabbling rather than fulfilling his campaign commitments. Now, fully in control of his government and with an eye towards the 2023 reelection cycle, Tshisekedi is in desperate need of an image overhaul.The bureaucratic cycles of regional institutions seem perfectly aligned to give Tshisekedi the multilateral legitimacy he so desperately needs. In February, the DRC took over the rotating chairship of the African Union (AU), giving Tshisekedi a full year at the helm of the continent’s largest institution. The country is also poised to ascend to the East African Community (EAC) after years of delay, with regional partners optimistic about the prospects of building ties with Tshisekedi independent of Kabila’s influence.Tshisekedi has wasted no time in outlining ambitious plans for the DRC’s forthcoming institutional engagement. His agenda for the AU chairship prioritizes regional integration, enhancing economic ties and calling on African partners to help curb insecurity in the eastern DRC. He has also committed to investing in AU-U.S. relations, seeking to rebuild ties after previous AU leaders distanced themselves from the Trump Administration amid his travel ban on many African countries.Commentary on the DRC’s likely ascension to the EAC has tended to focus on the economic advantages of the move, which is anticipated to jumpstart Tshisekedi’s development agenda and bring renewed revenue flows to African businesses struggling with the economic fallout of Covid-19. Growing trade relations with the East African bloc may also deepen political integration in the region, limiting China’s influence in the DRC; Beijing currently supplies nearly a third of the country’s total imports. Particularly with other regional leaders speaking out against China’s so-called “debt-trap diplomacy,” Tshisekedi’s adoption of African trading partners in lieu of Beijing will certainly come as a welcome signal of cooperation. Shared institutional interests through the EAC may also present a forum for unifying economic bonds or deeper security cooperation to address rebel activity in the DRC’s Ituri and Kivu provinces.Tshisekedi’s campaign to build ties with other African powers has been extensively covered in recent weeks, with reporting of the “new” DRC emerging under his leadership. Just a few months into his independent rule, Tshisekedi is already reaping the benefits of his modernizing agenda that presents him as an engaged, issue-focused leader – a reputation he hopes will cement his stake in the DRC’s 2023 elections. But as a leader that himself came to power through a backroom deal, Tshisekedi knows better than most that popularity alone is not a guarantee of security.Mere weeks after ousting pro-Kabila elements from his government, Tshisekedi took the unprecedented step of declaring a “state of siege” in eastern DRC, effectively imposing martial law on the Kivu and Ituri provinces that have faced rebel violence and insecurity for decades. While particular attention to these regions is certainly warranted, commentators agree that Tshisekedi’s move was a political message more than anything else. According to Africanist Phil Clark, the real message is that “whenever the opposition rules the provincial government, you get mass violence, you get this mass insecurity.”The reform-minded leader with ambitions for regional integration is only one side of Tshisekedi. Beyond the modernizing face is a fundamentally insecure president who fears being supplanted by a wildcard candidate, just as he cut a deal to edge out Fayulu in 2018. The reliance on Kabila-esque tactics to suppress opposition voices in Eastern DRC represents the other side of the “new” DRC. Janus is now in charge.',\n",

       " 'SC/14483The following Security Council press statement was issued today by Council President Linda Thomas-Greenfield (United States):The members of the Security Council met on 30 March 2021 to discuss the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and activities of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). They were briefed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bintou Keita.The members of the Security Council welcomed the efforts of President Tshisekedi towards reconciliation and peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They further welcomed the steps he has taken to fight corruption and impunity, and encouraged further action to ensure the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo respects human rights and fundamental freedoms.The members of the Security Council took note of the efforts towards forming a Government to deliver on President Tshisekedi’s commitments to pursue national unity, strengthen the rule of law, and further political inclusiveness and peacebuilding. They further took note of President Tshisekedi’s intention for that Government to be composed of 30 per cent of women.The members of the Security Council noted that political stability and security, as well as increased State presence in areas of conflict are critical for the consolidation of sustainable peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They encouraged the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to pursue its efforts in this regard, including by developing and implementing a national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration framework, a security sector reform plan and a comprehensive stabilization and conflict prevention strategy.The members of the Security Council recalled the importance of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbours working together to tackle insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo with further political commitment and more integrated approaches, including through economic cooperation and integration, and encouraged further efforts to foster sustainable economic development as a driver for regional peace and to address the root causes of conflict, including the illicit exploitation and trafficking of natural resources, as well as through poverty reduction. They welcomed steps taken by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region in that regard. They further welcomed the United Nations Strategy for Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution in the Great Lakes Region and looked forward to an inclusive articulation of an action plan for its operationalization and implementation.The members of the Security Council expressed concern at the continuing intercommunal violence and at the increase of armed group activity in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly by the Allied Democratic Forces in North Kivu and Ituri, and numerous local armed groups in South Kivu. They reiterated their condemnation of all armed groups operating in the country, called on all actors to end violence and their violations and abuse of international human rights and international humanitarian law.The members of the Security Council further expressed concern at the current humanitarian situation, marked by a significant increase in the number of people in need of protection and humanitarian assistance. They called on the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to address the underlying drivers of the current humanitarian situation and on partners to step up their support to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in tackling these challenges.The members of the Security Council reaffirmed their strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The members of the Security Council reiterated their continued support and commitment, in collaboration with regional actors and international partners, for the consolidation of peace, stability and development in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They further reiterated their full support to MONUSCO and to the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bintou Keita and encouraged the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to engage on the development of a detailed transition plan for the progressive and phased drawdown of the Mission.For information media.

       " 'The Democratic Republic of Congo has rejoined a key trade partnership with the United States that will grant it duty free access to US markets.  It follows a proclamation issued by outgoing US President Donald Trump on Tuesday night.  Washington suspended DR Congo from the  African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) some 10 years ago because of alleged human rights violations under former president Joseph Kabila.The decision affirms President Tshisekedi’s efforts to reform and strengthen the DRC’s democratic institutions, protect human rights, and fight corruption.Since its enactment in 2000, AGOA has been at the core of US economic policy and commercial engagement with Africa.It provides eligible Sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to the US market for over 1,800 products. That adds up to more than 5,000 products eligible for duty-free access under the Generalized System of Preferences program.DR Congo\\'s main exports, copper and cobalt, are included in the agreement but are already tariff-free under the System of Preferences.  The announcement comes during a turbulent period in the DRC\\'s politics. President Tshisekedi, who has been in office since January 2019, ended a coalition in December which was dominated by supporters of his powerful predecessor Joseph Kabila, who ruled for 18 years. The move prompted abrawl in parliament with ministers overturning desks and throwing chairs.“It is recognition of President Tshisekedi’s commitment to bringing about the change the Congolese people desire and deserve,” Mike Hammer, the US ambassador to Congo, said in a statement.  “The return of DRC to AGOA is a significant achievement that is a clear manifestation of our Privileged Partnership for Peace and Prosperity,\" said Mike Hammer, the US ambassador to Congo. The United States established the US-DRC Privileged Partnership for Peace and Prosperity in 2019 to combat corruption, protect human rights, strengthen democratic institutions.The partnership seeks to confront potential pandemics, promote peace and security, build a stronger bilateral relationship, and deliver results for the U.S. and Congolese people.\\'\\'The reinstatement of AGOA eligibility is another landmark achievement showing the progress made toward our shared goals.\\'\\'',\n",

       " 'Many governments are falling behind on their commitments under the African Union’s anti-corruption conventionTranslations:Image: GovernmentZA / FlickrWhen the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption (AUCPCC) was adopted by the African Union Assembly in 2003, it was a huge step towards resolving the continent’s serious corruption challenges. Designed as a shared roadmap for member states to implement governance and anti-corruption measures, the convention aims to eradicate corruption in government and business. Today, 44 of the 55 member states have ratified the convention, yet there is little information on how well it is implemented in practice. A new report by Transparency International explores this, looking at three important areas: money laundering, illicit enrichment and political party funding, as well as the role civil society and media play in fighting corruption.Money laundering facilitates heinous crimes that damage the lives of millions of Africans across the continent. When criminals make money through arms sales, poaching or corruption, they need to make the cash appear clean before they can use it. Under the AUCPCC, countries are meant to make money laundering illegal. Most countries have done so, but the convention does not give them a framework for how to prevent it, nor does it equip authorities with the tools they need to investigate and prosecute money launderers. Another problem is a lack of data on how effective the tools in place actually are. Based on what data there is, it seems that most countries could be doing a lot more.To effectively track and prosecute money laundering, African governments need to dedicate more resources to specialist skills, such as financial analysts and tax inspectors, and improve cooperation between these experts and prosecutors. Just as important is ensuring complete independence of authorities and courts to prevent well-connected money launderers from escaping prosecutions and convictions. The Mozambican courts stood up against high-level corruption in 2020: a former transport minister was put on trial for money laundering in connection with the national airline’s purchase of two Embraer planes.

       " 'When government officials channel public funds into their own pockets, they hinder the development of local communities and entire countries. Illicit enrichment is a crime under the AUCPCC, though few member states do enough to enforce the laws. The offence is notoriously difficult to prosecute, not least because many suspected offenders are high-profile and well-connected figures, who often enjoy political immunity. This often involves unduly influencing judges: in Nigeria, a serving judge of the Federal High Court had received US$260,000 – paid into his personal bank account over a two-year period – and was unable to show a legitimate source of the deposits. Still, the appeals court dismissed all charges on procedural grounds. The lack of necessary expertise and tools coupled with the limited autonomy of justice authorities are key challenges in fighting corruption across the continent. As a result, most countries have only prosecuted a few officials - in some countries, none at all. African governments need more robust systems in place to make it illegal and very difficult for public officials to enrich themselves through corrupt acts. The burden should lie with the accused to explain and prove the legitimate sources of their assets and – if they fail to – conviction and forfeiture should follow. This would require authorities to have full independence to investigate and prosecute, and more specialist skills to do so. As with money laundering, reliable data on the effectiveness of enforcement is scarce, making monitoring challenging. Data on prosecuted cases and outcomes should be made publicly available on an annual basis.A new Transparency International report assesses the state of implementation of the AUCPCC in 10 countries and aims to support policy-makers and civil society members from these countries to identify key challenges that need to be addressed to improve both the legal framework and enforcement in four key areas of the convention.When money from opaque and unregulated sources is allowed to infiltrate politics, it becomes difficult to hold politicians and their parties accountable. Lack of transparency in political party funding also allows hidden actors to finance and buy politicians for their own interests – states get captured by the corrupt.Compared to some other anti-corruption treaties, the AUCPCC is unique in placing a clear obligation on state parties to legislate for and effectively enforce transparency requirements for political party funding. However, most countries fail to expressly ban the use of illegally acquired funds in political financing. Even where strong legislation is in place, it is rarely enforced, and when enforcement does occur, sanctions are either too lenient or too severe: some overly light sentences fail to discourage offenders while in other cases political parties get broken up, which harms democracy. In the last decade, Tunisia has policed money in politics unevenly. During the 2011 elections, authorities actively fulfilled their oversight responsibilities, imposing sanctions for party funding violations and even annulling certain election results. Since the rules were relaxed in 2014, reports of unsanctioned overspending',\n",
       " 'have emerged and very few parties have submitted their financial records as required and on time: only 5 of the 221 political parties regularly submitted their financial reports between 2014 and 2019. However, parties only received warnings, which haven’t led to widespread change in behaviour.African governments should adopt measures to prohibit dirty money funding their political parties, and close loopholes such as third-party donations or sponsorships that can serve to hide the origins or the actual recipient of the money. Placing limits on how much a single donor can donate over a given period of time could help prevent a party from owing favours to wealthy individuals. Parties should be required to make all financial reports publicly available every year, with additional reporting before and after major elections. Additionally, sanctions should be reviewed to ensure they are proportionate and, as such, more effective. When it comes to investigating and drawing attention to abuses of power and corrupt practices, civil society and media play a critical role. The impact they can have is seen in South Africa, which has a vibrant and diverse civil society and media landscape, in particular through specialist investigative journalist groups. In 2017, for example, South African journalists exposed the corruption connected to a campaign of provoking of racial tensions that was led by the Gupta family and a British public relations firm.But civil society and media can only hold governments and elected officials accountable when citizens have freedom of expression and access to information. The AUCPCC introduces a requirement for extensive rights to information, in particular for the media, but its scope is non-specific and governments are managing to limit what they reveal. All member states should review their legislative framework on freedom of expression, association and information to ensure their media and civil society can operate free of interference and intimidation. When allegations of harassment, violence or indiscriminate arrests of journalists and activists occur, these should be vigorously investigated. State interference in media reports should be avoided, and refusals of requests for information should be subject to appeal or review. Our report aims to support policy makers and civil society members to identify key challenges to address in order to improve both the legal framework and the enforcement of selected anti-corruption provisions contained in the AUCPCC.

DAS Bradley also met with the Coordinator of the Agency for the Prevention and Fight Against Corruption, the Inspector General of Finance, and Executive Secretary of the Financial Intelligence Unit to accelerate efforts to bring corrupt individuals to justice. Bradley highlighted how INL assistance can strengthen their institutions’ ability to investigate allegations of human rights abuses and hold corrupt actors accountable, as well as the need to protect whistleblowers and journalists who expose criminal activity.With Vice Minister of Interior Jean Claude Mol and the Congolese National Police, Bradley reiterated the U.S. commitment to supporting police reform in the DRC, including an additional program that will focus on improving police accountability. In addition, the Ministry of Environment briefed Bradley on Vice Prime Minister Bazaiba’s reform agenda to better ensure DRC’s natural spaces and wildlife are protected for the benefit of the Congolese people and the world. Eliminating illicit economic activities will contribute to promoting peace and security in Eastern DRC.In Nord Kivu, Bradley met with Vice Governor General Romy Ekuka, environmental lawyers, and visited Virunga National Park to observe INL-funded programs and how they are combatting mineral and wildlife trafficking that fuels crime and instability. Together with the Congolese National Police, Bradley participated in the signing of the transfer of a new INL-funded mining police station for Walikale. Twenty-eight newly trained police will work with community leaders in Walikale to combat mineral trafficking and prevent child labor. In Virunga, Bradley met with DRC’s first ever park ranger pilot trainees who, through support from INL, will strengthen surveillance and detection of illegal activity throughout the park, that will contribute to the fight against wildlife trafficking.“We created this partnership and will continue to provide this assistance in North and South Kivu because tackling mineral and wildlife trafficking contributes to a more stable security environment for the citizens of the DRC, which is essential for the country’s prosperity,” Bradley explained.Regarding his visit, DAS Bradley concluded: “From President Tshisekedi to committed police leaders who want change, I heard acknowledgement of and steadfast determination to tackle corruption, which President Tshisekedi rightfully called ‘the gangrene that is everywhere.’ INL looks forward to expanding our work together to enable DRC to deliver results for the Congolese people, reach its true economic potential, and become a net contributor to regional peace and security.”The Bureau of INL, part of the United States Department of State, fights crime by helping foreign governments build effective law enforcement institutions that counter transnational crime, combats corruption, and builds transparent and accountable public institutions—a cornerstone of strong, stable, and fair societies.By U.S. Embassy Kinshasa | 3 August, 2021 | Topics: Press ReleasesFooter Disclaimer This is the official website of the U.S. Embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

They include OCIDC, ODEP and the APLC, which are civil society groups and coalitions demanding transparency from President Felix Tshisekedi and a government long known for lining the pockets of elites at the expense of its citizens.The fake YouTube channel comes amid renewed interest in international businessman Dan Gertler, a close associate of former president Joseph Kabila who was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2017. Those sanctions were eased last month as former U.S. president Donald Trump was leaving office.It also follows the emergence of two Afriland First Bank whistleblowers, auditors Gradi Koko Lobanga and Navy Malela, who have agreed to testify about Gertler’s activities despite the consequences for their own safety. Afriland was named in a July 2020 report from the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa and Global Witness, which charges the bank is at the center of a scheme used by Gertler and his associates to work around the sanctions.“These revelations have led to investigations by international media outlets that will be published in the coming days,” said PPLAAF on Friday.President Xi Jinping of China has pledged to deliver another 1 billion COVID vaccine doses…',\n",

It was on that basis that parliament agreed to exempt Sicomines from all taxes, the draft says.Under the 2017 amendment, seen by Reuters, only 65% of Sicomines\\' profits must initially go toward reimbursing the investments while 35% goes to shareholders.The change could further slow the pace of the infrastructure projects, the draft says. To date, less than $1 billion of the expected $3 billion has been invested, about $1 billion less than projected at this stage, it says.\"This amendment constitutes a violation of the security of the interests of the Republic,\" the draft says.The draft report calls for re-evaluating Sicomines\\' reserves, saying a 2010 feasibility study 2010 was flawed, and cancelling another contract with the same Chinese investors to build a hydroelectric dam.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

       " 'The killing of the Italian ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the lifting of U.S. Treasury sanctions against an Israeli businessman accused of mining-related corruption in the final hours of the Trump administration has again focused international attention on the interlocking crises in the DRC.Italian Amb. Luca Attanasio was killed when the World Food Programme caravan he was part of was stopped en route to a school feeding program in Rutshuru, near Goma, in eastern Congo. (His driver and bodyguard were also killed.) The DRC authorities are claiming that the perpetrators were part of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR); the militia denies it. The FDLR, one of some 120 separate armed groups [PDF] operating in eastern Congo, is associated with the Rwandan cabal that led the 1994 Rwandan genocide; Congolese officials frequently blame it for atrocities in\\xa0eastern Congo.More on:',\n",

       " \"Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining merchant closely associated with former DRC dictator Laurent Kabila and his son-turned-successor, Joseph Kabila, in 2017 was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department after being widely accused of staggering corruption. Those sanctions excluded him from the\\xa0American financial system and blocked access to his\\xa0American accounts. The Trump administration in its final hours in office quietly eased those sanctions. Their easing, while not necessarily illegal, violated usual Treasury procedures and has\\xa0provoked outrage among human rights activists in the United States, the DRC, and elsewhere. Critics see the reprieve as a part of President Trump's wave of pardons to criminals with good connections. According to the media, the Biden administration is likely to reverse the move.Eastern Congo is a stark example of great wealth—mostly based on the strategic minerals that have made Mr. Gertler rich—amidst grinding poverty. Militias and gangs, allegedly with ties to neighboring Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda, are active. Ethnic conflict is widespread. Criminality, sometimes with political links, is ubiquitous. Ebola recurs; new cases\\xa0have been reported this month. Government at the national and provincial levels is notorious for corruption and appears largely alienated from the people who live there. The DRC is far from fulfilling the basic requirement of sovereignty—guaranteeing the security of its citizens.The ambassador's reputation was that he was devoted to his humanitarian mission, that he was judicious, and did not take unnecessary risks. The road traveled by the convoy was regarded as safe. So, what group killed the Italian ambassador? It may have been by a group with a political agenda. But the event also has elements of being primarily a criminal enterprise: after capturing the ambassador, the perpetrators moved him into the bush, in what is believed to have been an attempted kidnapping. He was killed only after security forces attempted to rescue him.More on:\",\n",

       " \"(Kinshasa) – Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo should quash the death sentences imposed in absentia on two whistleblowers who provided information on corruption. Congolese authorities should instead investigate the allegations of criminal activity reported by Gradi Koko and Navy Malela, two former bank employees who exposed alleged illegal financial practices and money laundering.Koko and Malela both worked in the audit department of Afriland First Bank CD, the Congolese subsidiary of Afriland First Bank, whose headquarters are in Cameroon. Koko said that in 2018 his superiors at the bank directly threatened him after he reported serious financial irregularities internally. In the face of these threats, he and Malela shared a trove of data and documents with the Platform for the Protection of African Whistleblowers (PPLAAF), a nongovernmental organization based in France. The information they provided led to a series of investigative reports in July 2020 by PPLAAF, Global Witness, and media outlets, including Bloomberg, Le Monde, and Haaretz.“Congolese authorities have made a mockery of the rule of law by prosecuting two whistleblowers for revealing information of major public interest that’s critically important to Congolese institutions,” said Thomas Fessy, senior Congo researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Their convictions should be quashed, and their revelations should be the basis for independent and impartial investigations.”The published reports allege that Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a longtime friend of former Congo President Joseph Kabila, established a money laundering network with Afriland First Bank CD at its center. The scheme purportedly helped Gertler evade United States government sanctions against him and to acquire new mining assets in Congo.Koko fled Congo in 2018 and sought asylum in Europe; Malela followed in early 2020. On February 26, 2021, they revealed that they were the source of the reports.“I am not an armed rebel chief and my denunciations are useful to Congo, so why should I be sentenced to death?” Koko told Human Rights Watch by phone. “I fear reprisals, and I fear for my family in Kinshasa.”On February 25, representatives for Afriland and Gertler told journalists at a news conference in Kinshasa that the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Kinshasa had sentenced the whistleblowers to death in absentia on September 7 for “forgery,” “theft,” “private corruption,” “breach of professional secrecy,” and “criminal conspiracy.” Neither Malela nor Koko – or their lawyer – had knowledge of the court hearing. The trial violated the men’s right to a fair trial under international law, Human Rights Watch said.Shortly after the February 25 news conference, a Congolese news outlet posted a copy of the verdict online and shared it on social media. “How could we possibly discover the copy of this judgment, of which we had no knowledge, on social media?” Koko said.The verdict reiterated unfounded and baseless allegations against PPLAAF and Global Witness that first emerged after publication of their July 2020 report. It included claims made in video clips shared by newly created social media accounts that the organizations had used underhanded methods to collect their information. In a statement issued on March 5, Global Witness said the “the false and highly defamatory allegations … [had] no factual basis whatsoever.”On February 26, new investigations based on another batch of leaked bank records reported more details about Gertler’s elaborate system of alleged money laundering, and showed that Afriland First Bank CD also harbored accounts for several companies tied to alleged financiers of Hezbollah and people suspected of links to North Korea’s armament program. Other records showed large sums of money allegedly transiting through the personal accounts of some Congolese officials.Afriland First Bank CD denied all allegations of wrongdoing to Radio France Internationale. Gertler has also rejected all accusations of corruption and sanctions violations and said that Koko and Malela were “victims” of “appalling conduct” by anti-graft organizations.Also on February 26, a fake YouTube channel was created impersonating the anticorruption watchdog Transparency International. The channel posted videos targeting anticorruption organizations working in Congo. It followed a months-long online smear campaign and abuse against the investigative consortium that revealed the alleged money laundering ring in 2020.The latest revelations came a month after it emerged that Gertler had been granted a special license by the Trump administration in its waning days, effectively lifting US sanctions against him for one year. On March 8, 2021, in response to domestic and international outrage, the Biden administration revoked this license, reiterating that Gertler had “engaged in extensive public corruption.”The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office and the embassies of Belgium, France, and the US have all raised concerns about the sentences handed down against Koko and Malela. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty. \\xa0Congolese authorities should immediately exonerate Koko and Malela or risk deterring future whistleblowers, Human Rights Watch said. The government should provide both men’s families in Congo with physical protection, while any intimidation and harassment against them should be investigated.The government should investigate and appropriately prosecute the allegations of illegal practices within the banking system.“Whistleblowers take enormous risks to contribute to a healthy democracy and defend the public good,” Fessy said. “The real culprits should be found among those whose impunity allows them to siphon Congo’s wealth and hinder its development.”European Development Banks’ Link to Abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Palm Oil IndustryThe Impact of Lead Contamination on Children’s Rights in Kabwe, Zambia\",\n",

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a Strategic Partner. moreThe primary and secondary education sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faces massive challenges. These include insufficient budgets, payroll fraud, a lack of infrastructure and teaching material, and poor opportunities for teacher professional development. Educational officials aren’t being held accountable for policy failures.One of the biggest hurdles has to do with the teacher payroll. In general, the  country’s teachers – more than 500,000 – work under dire conditions. In particular, a significant number of school teachers in the DRC have gone without government pay for several years. Since the early 1990s, parents have been called upon to step in to support teachers and schools financially by paying substantial school fees. Providing quality education isn’t always at the top of teacher priorities as they struggle to supplement their income with other activities. Two years ago, the government decided to abolish primary school fees. The idea was that the government would pay all teachers. However, drawing on our long engagement with the DRC’s education sector and political system, we believe that this will be a challenge because of political, budgetary and administrative issues. In April this year, Tony Mwaba, one of the most ferocious critics of corruption in the education sector, was appointed the new minister of education. This followed the conviction of former education officials, including the former minister of education, for corruption and money laundering. Is this the start of a serious reform of the battered education sector? We believe that sustainable change in this system would require a thorough restructuring of the mechanisms of political accountability. In the meantime, we can only expect a realignment of existing patronage networks to the political agenda of the current president.In November 2020, the DRC’s auditor general published a report which revealed the depths of the payroll crisis. Masses of teachers remained unpaid while new ones were being added to the payroll. There was also an influx of administrative staff, diverting resources from teacher salaries. The report revealed the embezzlement of 62 billion Congolese francs (about US$30 million) and other forms of payroll fraud.Payroll fraud permeates the public sector, and this has been a persistent problem in the DRC. The report implicated senior civil servants and staff from the ministries of budget and finance, education and the teachers’ payroll agency. The issue reverberated in the provinces as well. Several officials were placed under arrest.The boundary between “state” and “society” has become a twilight area in the DRC, whose dynamics are governed by specific social pressures, economic rents and political considerations. For example, relationships with politicians, due to party affiliation or origin, increase a school’s chances of being added to the payroll. Another example is the attempted removal of 1,179 schools from the payroll. As reactions by educational leaders suggest, some of these schools have properly functioned for decades. In the past, masses of other schools have obtained their decree via informal processes, void of any educational planning. What is the difference between schools functioning on “false” decrees, and schools functioning on decrees based purely on patronage without any technical preparation and monitoring?Government actors who benefit from the current structures have few incentives to clean up the payroll. However, teacher union politics also partially explains these continued dynamics. There’s a lack of strong, independent unions and a lack of trust between teachers and unions. Also the political co-option of union leaders, for example by mobilising them as consultants or by inviting them into party politics, has weakened the unions’ impact. Out of 40 unions, only a handful can be considered to be functioning properly. With a dozen pseudo-unions and a high number of unions which hardly function, Congolese teacher unions have been effectively silenced.Trying to reform human resource and payroll management means taking away a massive resource of patronage and electoral politics from hundreds of bureaucrats and politicians.Public statements to fight against payroll fraud seem to materialise at strategic moments. In 1979, the former president of the Democratic Republic of  Congo (then Zaire), Mobutu Sese Seko, stated that:We’re going to wipe out the imaginary schools and the fake teachers who exist only on paper. For Mobutu, it was a way to attract World Bank funding. So, what was the reason for the most recent announcement? The investigations, and Mwaba’s appointment, are nested within Congolese political dynamics, and it is necessary to look beyond the education sector. For 15 years, according to our sources, the education ministry functioned as a cash cow for long-term ruler Joseph Kabila’s party. When Félix Tshisekedi was elected president in 2019, in what is seen as a rigged election, he formed a coalition with  Kabila. The investigations and sentences of high-level educational officials sit within Tshisekedi’s much wider use of “judicial harassment” against key persons from Kabila’s camp.   Given that Tshisekedi’s coalition remains unstable and based on members of parliament who will “condition their support upon payments or extractive opportunities”, he will need all possible sources to gather funds. This is all the more the case as the DRC looks forward to a new round of elections in 2023.So this is the situation in which the president finds himself: while the judicial investigations and new appointment indicate that using the payroll for patronage purposes is being addressed, now that he’s completely in power himself, Tshisekedi might be tempted to deviate from the norms through which he won his position. With an education sector struggling to cope through patronage politics and informal arrangements, and with all of the high level dynamics at play, can the new education minister bring much needed change? We truly hope so, but he would have to swim against a strong tide. For a longer French version of this article, please see here.\",\n",

The delegation also held discussions with the National Assembly leadership including President Mboso, Vice President Kabund, and new Human Rights Committee Chair Iyananio Moligi where we discussed important legislative initiatives like a new Anti-human Trafficking Law, the recently passed CENI law, as well as the law affording the autochthonous people’s protections. Plus, Ambassador Peterson met with National Police leadership, representatives from DRC’s Council of Bishops (CENCO) and Church of Christ in Congo (ECC), Congolese civil society leaders, one of the leaders of the opposition Martin Fayulu, and senior officers from the UN Stabilization Mission in the Congo (MONUSCO).\\xa0Throughout the visit, Ambassador Peterson stressed the importance of civilian protections and accountability for human rights violations.\\xa0\\xa0“I served previously in Kinshasa in the 1990s and during this visit I was impressed with the palpable change that is taking place with a clear opening of political space and a serious commitment by the government to improving human rights.\\xa0 These positive developments under President Tshisekedi’s leadership are important but, as we discussed during the Dialogue, more progress is necessary.\\xa0 That is why during our talks we pledged to increase our cooperation to address continuing concerns about press freedom, and\\xa0child labor, as well as to improve gender equality.”\\xa0Together with DRC government interlocutors, Ambassador Peterson underscored that the state of siege in eastern DRC highlights the critical need to strengthen protections for Congolese citizens, who have suffered from brutal violence for far too long at the hands of armed groups, terrorists and criminal gangs.\\xa0 Ambassador Peterson also highlighted the importance of protecting and preserving fundamental freedoms and civic space for all Congolese, and of ensuring that human rights defenders, journalists, and civil society members can express themselves freely without fearing reprisals or abuse from state security forces.\\xa0 Ambassador Peterson agreed with her Congolese counterparts that ending impunity must be a priority, whether in the case of the\\xa0murders of UN experts Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalan or all those crimes committed against Congolese citizens in Eastern DRC over the past twenty years, including by using the UN’s Mapping Report to seek justice.

Trump’s administration.The United States first froze Gertler, a mining mogul, out of the U.S. financial system in 2017, weeks after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ Paradise Papers investigation. Officials accused Gertler of having “amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).” The sanctions were extended in 2018. Gertler denies wrongdoing.In January, the outgoing Trump administration granted a license that unfroze some of Gertler’s money held in U.S. institutions, including Deutsche Bank, and allowed his companies to re-enter the financial system. The reprieve angered civil society who have long reported on Gertler’s alleged corruption. It surprised U.S. officials, according to a New York Times investigation of the lobbying, which involved Alan Dershowitz, who later served as a lawyer to President Trump.Last month, journalists reported that companies linked to Gertler bypassed U.S. sanctions with the help of one of Central Africa’s largest banks. The investigation was organized by the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa, which previously provided ICIJ with more than 700,000 documents that formed the basis of the Luanda Leaks investigation.As early as 2001, the United Nations linked Gertler to the “illegal exploitation” of valuable DRC resources. Gertler, who has close ties to former DRC President Joseph Kabila, owned a company that received a lucrative diamond-mining monopoly, U.N. reports alleged. Gertler agreed to exchange diamonds for the delivery of weapons to Congolese armed forces, according to the U.N. panel. Gertler rejected the findings and said his company complied with its obligations.In 2017, as part of the Paradise Papers investigation, ICIJ and media partners revealed how Swiss multinational Glencore, one of the world’s largest commodity traders, discussed appointing Gertler to “negotiate with the DRC authorities” after officials pushed back on a deal for valuable copper deposits. The revelations showed Glencore provided a $45 million loan to a Gertler-controlled company while the tycoon helped Glencore seal a deal with the DRC government.Glencore denied wrongdoing and said that its background checks on Gertler were “extensive and thorough.” Responding to ICIJ’s questions, Gertler hired lawyers in three countries and sent a 33-page letter that claimed accusations of criminal behavior were false.Senior reporter and Africa coordinatorHelp us change the world.

       " 'Global Witness says at least $750m paid to Congo’s tax bodies and state mining company disappeared in 2013-2015.The Democratic Republic of Congo is losing a fifth of all of mining revenues because of corruption and mismanagement, a campaign group has said.In a report published on Friday, Global Witness said at least $750m paid by companies to the Congo’s tax agencies and state-owned mining company Gecamines disappeared between 2013 and 2015.At least some of the funds were distributed among corrupt networks linked to President Joseph Kabila, the group said.The losses deprived the state of funds that should have been used on public services, it added.Congo is Africa’s top copper producer and the world’s biggest supplier of cobalt, which is used in mobile phones and electric cars. It also produces coltan, diamonds, tin and gold. However, it remains one of the poorest countries in the world.

       " 'The political turmoil and persistently low prices for Congo’s exports has caused the franc to lose 40 percent of its value in the past year.Global Witness said a key cause of discontent with the regime was the chronic lack of funding by the government in basic services such as schools, hospitals and roads.The main culprit in the diversion of funds was Gecamines, a state-owned company tasked with the exploration, research and production of Congo’s mineral deposits, its report said.Gecamines is “haemorrhaging money in suspect transactions … while simultaneously failing to make any substantial contribution to the national treasury or invest in its own mining operations,” the report said. Congo’s “secretive” tax agencies, meanwhile, “keep back a portion of mining revenues for their ‘own funds’ rather than transfer it to the treasury,” it added.\\xa0The missing revenues rise to\\xa0$1.3bn when other state bodies and a now-defunct provincial tax body were included, it said.Lambert Mende, a spokesman for Kabila, said the judiciary would deal with corruption cases. “We have institutions in charge of handling such cases. The courts are working and if it’s true that money from mining revenues is being embezzled, those involved will be brought to court and be prosecuted,” Mende told the DPA news agency.More than two million voters expected to elect National Assembly members as well as local councils.Violence between troops and armed fighters in the DR Congo has killed thousands of people since August.Follow Al Jazeera English:Sign up for our newsletter.Quality journalism.

The People\\'s Republic of China (PRC) shares ideological bonds with many African countries because of early ties to anti-colonial struggles and through the Non-Aligned Movement. Every African country recognizes the PRC with the exception of eSwatini (Swaziland), which has diplomatic relations with Taiwan). Many African countries preserved trade relations with Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, and those commercial links have only grown stronger. China has been Africa\\'s leading trading partner since surpassing the United States in 2009.Criticisms have focused on adverse environmental impacts, violations of labor laws and human rights, and corrupt practices.Many African governments seek Chinese assistance through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to bridge the continent\\'s infrastructure gap, while China in turn seeks access to a number of key strategic resources, including fossil fuels, minerals, and also access largely untapped markets. In addition to being rich in natural resources, some African countries attract Chinese interest because of relatively cheap labor, poor governance, and lax environmental standards. In 2017, McKinsey reported that more than 10,000 Chinese companies are likely operating throughout Africa.The amount of money involved is staggering. According to a 2021 report from the Shanghai University of International Business and Economics, China has since 2000 invested a total of $47 billion throughout Africa (in 52 out of 54 countries), with new investments adding up to $2.96 billion in 2020 (an increase of over $200 million from the previous year). The vast majority of Chinese investment—87 percent—has been concentrated in four sectors: energy, transport, metals, and real estate. China\\'s Export-Import Bank provides much of the financing for infrastructure projects in Africa, but a number of commercial banks have also established branches throughout the continent.Yet, despite these numbers, Africa attracted only 2 percent of Chinese foreign investment in 2019.The impact of Chinese economic interactions with Africa can also be measured at an individual level. \"There are no individuals in Nigeria who don\\'t have Chinese goods,\" reports Tijani Abdulkareem, the executive director of the Socio-Economic Research and Development Centre in Abuja. \"It\\'s the food that they eat, the wristwatches they own, the clothes that they wear.\"China\\'s footprint in Africa, however, has caused considerable anger, resentment, and pushback from communities in and around the projects that China has financed, constructed, or promoted, particularly those involving extraction industries. Criticisms have focused on adverse environmental impacts, violations of labor laws and human rights, and corrupt practices.In a webinar entitled Voices from Africa: Activist Perspectives on Chinese Investments, sponsored by the Africa Climate Justice Group, six representatives from civil society organizations around Africa provided their on-the-ground perspective on Chinese activities in mining and extraction in their community followed by commentary from an expert on Chinese investments in Africa. The following report is a synthesis of their presentations.Infrastructure ProjectsChina has invested in a number of high-profile infrastructure projects throughout the continent, including a $7 billion oil pipeline in Niger, a $1.3 billion port project in Cameroon, and a $3.6 billion investment into the aluminum sector in Guinea. Many of these projects are designed to facilitate access to raw materials and speed their export via roads, rail, or port.China is also off-shoring its manufacturing capacities: because of their negative environmental impact, to reduce China\\'s own carbon footprint, and to take advantage of lower labor costs and proximity to raw materials. Africa needs to create labor-intensive manufacturing at the same time that China is hoping to decrease that manufacturing.In Nigeria, Tijani Abdulkareem points out, 218 Chinese firms are involved in everything from the construction industry to the food and beverage sector. Big-ticket infrastructure projects include the $5.8 billion hydroelectric Mambilla Dam, a $2.8 billion gas pipeline, a $1.5 billion harbor complex, and a $200 million airport serving Abuja.In Guinea, reports Aboubacar Diallo of the Centre du Commerce in Conakry, China is providing $20 billion in infrastructure funding in exchange for mining concessions, an agreement that will last from 2017 to 2036. China has already invested in several hydropower plants. But the focus of its interest now is access to critical ores like iron and bauxite as well as a refinery to turn that bauxite into aluminum and a port to export the metal. In exchange, China has pledged to reconstruct a major road at the cost of $2.1 billion, rebuild four universities at a cost of $300 million, rehabilitate roads and sanitation in the capital of Conakry, and set up an electricity grid for $250 million. Only the road has been started, however, and the other three major projects have been delayed.One of the biggest proposed projects that China is spearheading on the continent is the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone in the Limpopo region of South Africa, which the government approved in 2016. Contracts have been awarded to a subsidiary of the Chinese firm Shenzhen Hoi Mor and nine other Chinese companies totally more than $10 billion in investments. This industrial development zone will center around processing minerals such as chrome, manganese, and iron as well as the manufacture of cement and steel. Providing power to the zone is a proposed 3.3-gigawatt coal-fired plant.In some African countries, however, infrastructure is conspicuously absent from the picture. Zimbabwe, mostly smaller scale Chinese companies have been involved in the mining sector. But as Farai Maguwu of the Centre for Natural Resource Governance in Harare points out, the Chinese \"don\\'t build anything in the area. They simply dig and leave behind open pits. There\\'s no investment in education or in road infrastructure, which they destroy using their machinery.\"The experience in South Sudan, where China has been developing oil fields since the 1990s, has been similar. \"The communities are supposed to benefit from the oil being produced in their area,\" observes Pach Ayuen Pach of the Heart of Mother Earth Foundation. \"It\\'s their right, but there are no good schools, no clean water, no roads, no hospitals, and nothing good for the community.\"Environmental ImpactThe environmental impact of Chinese investments depends on the nature of project, the behavior of Chinese firms, and the laws and enforcement of the host country.Chinese financing arms—the Ministry of Commerce, the Export-Import Bank—have environmental regulations on the books. But if you look closely, there are very few regulations and they largely apply to administrative processes. Chinese administrative agencies have to comply with regulations when they review investments, but there no laws to force them to screen these investments. There are no Environmental Impact Assessment requirements, no requirement of disclosure of Chinese overseas conduct.National environmental protection laws and oversight mechanisms vary widely across the continent. South Africa has perhaps the strongest environmental regulations on the books. For instance, NGO activists won a court case to shut down a proposed coal-fired plant in Mpumalanga province in July 2020. \"In South Africa, we do have legislation that helps us stop carbon-intensive projects,\" says David Tshidzumba of Save Our Limpopo Valley Environment.But so far activists have been unable to stop the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone on the grounds of environmental impact, largely because such SEZs are exempt from the usual environmental regulations. South Africa, Tshidzumba explains, is a water-scarce country and the site of the SEZ \"is one of the most water-scarce regions in the country.\" The industrial zone will need 80 million cubic liters of water per year, but it remains unclear where this water will come from. Also troubling is that the project will contribute a full 15 percent to South Africa\\'s carbon budget even as the government has agreed to reduce carbon emissions. \"If it goes ahead, South Africa will be on its backfoot,\" Tshidzumba continues. \"And we\\'ll probably see sanctions against South Africa because of this project.\" The Environmental Impact Assessment of the economic zone is still ongoing, but \"the Chinese speak of the project as if it is already been given the go-ahead.\"In Guinea, where Chinese investments have been concentrated in bauxite and iron industries, the mining has had tremendous impact on the land. \"Local law requires restoration of the land,\" Aboubacar Diallo reports, \"but none of it has been rehabilitated.\" Guinea also has mining laws that require compensation for land taken for such operations, yet companies have seized arable land and displaced people without providing compensation. Rice is the major crop, occupying nearly one-third of the arable land, but the discharge of lubricants and waste water from bauxite mining has compromised this food production. Dust from the mining has polluted the air, and there has been sound pollution as well from blasting and the use of heavy equipment.Sometimes the environmental impact stems from not only ostensibly legal projects but also illegal operations. Reporters in Nigeria, for instance, have exposed the pollution connected to illegal logging, fishing, and mining done either by Chinese entities or by local actors who then sell to Chinese firms. The impacts include \"increased flooding, erosion, the extinction of animals and plants,\" says Tijani Abdulkareem. \"Illegal logging denies communities sources of food and livelihood.\"Illegal fishing and mining are a problem as well in Madagascar, where China is a major trade partner. \"The Chinese use mercury for gold exploration even though it\\'s prohibited,\" reports Volahery Andriamanantenansoa of the Center for Research and Support for Alternatives to Development—Indian Ocean. \"The Malagasy government doesn\\'t have the means to do anything about it.\"But the principal mining interest China now has in Madagascar is rare earth minerals. Reducing the mining of these minerals in China itself, because of adverse effects on environment and health, Beijing is eager to find other sources of these critical inputs into high-tech products. In Madagascar, China expects to extract from 300-800 tons of rare earth minerals during the pilot phase of its extraction. But the removal of only one ton of such minerals generates 1,000 tons of contaminated water and 2,000 tons of toxic waste. Over the full lifetime of the project, which could be 40-50 years, that would total an astonishing 500 million tons of poisoned water and one billion tons of toxic waste. \"This is simply catastrophic,\" Volahery says. The mining will have a devastating impact on the rich biodiversity of the region, adversely affect the tourism sector, and undermine key agricultural products like vanilla and coffee.The mining company has \"promised to use less devastating technique,\" she continues, \"but they don\\'t have experience in rare earth mining.\" And even though these companies are well aware of the environmental impact this kind of mining has had in China, they are turning a blind eye to the consequences in Madagascar.In South Sudan, meanwhile, \"the Chinese are not observing international environmental standards,\" reports Pach Ayuen Pach, and their operations in the oil sector are \"causing air, water, and soil pollution,\" including the emission of gasses through diesel engine generators, the evaporation of gases from burrow pit, and the emission of unburned gasses at the field processing facilities. \"The oil industry in South Sudan has left a landscape pocked with hundreds of open waste pits along with water and soil contaminated by toxic chemicals,\" he concludes.Labor ImpactThe infrastructure projects and mining concessions are supposed to generate not only revenue for African governments but also jobs for local workers. African countries like South Africa, Nigeria, and Namibia have the highest rates of unemployment in the world at 33-34 percent.In many cases, Chinese firms have resisted hiring locally and has instead brought in their own workers from China. By the end of 2019, 182,000 Chinese were working Africa, many of them on construction projects. According to McKinsey, however, Chinese firms rely on Africans for nearly 90 percent of the jobs.Conditions at those jobs vary. At one factory in Zimbabwe, Farai Maguwu reports, \"workers allege that they are locked up during lunch hour. The Chinese say, \\'if we leave you free, you will steal.\\' They are only released after lunch hour. We have also seen Chinese discharge firearms where workers are demanding a minimum wage.\"Pach Ayuen Pach has been tasked with monitoring health and safety conditions for workers at the UNI Afro oil company in South Sudan. The Chinese company has largely ignored the South Sudanese labor laws. So, for instance, workers labor nine hours a day, seven days a week, 30 days a month. \"Employees have no option,\" he points out. \"It is either work or a pay cut, or dismissal. People in this regard choose to work even if it is against their personal health.\" The food provided lacks vegetables aside from raw onions; accommodation for Sudanese workers is of lesser quality than where Chinese workers stay. Workers are entitled to a month off every three months but at half-pay, which discourages them from taking the time off. The language barrier complicates all of these interactions.In South Africa, the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone will reportedly create as many as 53,000 jobs at the site plus many more in supporting industries. To get those jobs, the South African government has promised to apply special treatment such as tax-exemption and a waiver of import duties to the Chinese companies operating there, which means a considerable drop in government revenue.\"Whenever we try to delve into the details of the job creation,\" David Tshidzumba reports, \"we\\'re given the silent treatment. We need more transparency. Our laws afford us the opportunity to get that information.\"Lack of AccountabilityOne of the challenges of dealing with Chinese companies is the lack of transparency and clear lines of accountability. Some of that has to do with linguistic and cultural gaps. But it also reflects a certain pattern of corporate behavior.Even when communities and civil groups raise concerns with Chinese companies in Guinea—for instance about the violation of laws or rights—\"the companies continue to move ahead with impunity,\" observes Aboubacar Diallo. \"When a community contacts the World Bank, they are able to have recourse. That\\'s not the case with any Chinese company.\"\"Chinese companies don\\'t do business like other multinationals do,\" agrees Tijani Abdulkareem. \"Even when we raise issues of environmental degradation, they don\\'t care what civil society says. China made a commitment at the UN General Assembly to support clean energy. We have to step up our game to hold them to their commitments.\"In the case of rare earth mining in Madagascar, the company Reenova has deliberately avoided transparency to boost profits. Although Chinese in origin and based in Singapore, Reenova is registered in Mauritius in order to take advantage of a tax reduction agreement between that island and Madagascar. It was issued a permit for \"research\" in 2003 and, despite the prohibition against selling minerals extracted during such a period, company documents filed on the Singapore stock exchange suggest that it indeed plans to sell up to 800 tons of material mined during this pilot phase. Moreover, the company hasn\\'t consulted with the affected communities, offering only information about the purported benefits of the project and resorting to threats when the community remains unconvinced.In Zimbabwe, where the mining operations are smaller scale, the companies often have no physical address at all, not even a website. Still, they maintain close relations with the Zimbabwean government. In one case, the government sent out state security forces on behalf of a Chinese company to bulldoze a site in a community that clearly was opposed to coal mining. When the community continued to insist that the Chinese company leave, \"the Chinese instructed the government that the community leader be put in jail and barred from visiting the community for four months,\" Farai Maguwu reports.In another case, Maguwu asked the Zimbabwean parliament to investigate a Chinese company that was mining diamonds in partnership with the Zimbabwean defense industry. The Chinese were arguing that they were just in the \"exploration\" phase even though the same company \"had mined in the country from 2011 to 2015 before the former president kicked them out,\" Maguwu added. \"They returned in 2018. It doesn\\'t make sense that they are now doing \\'exploration.\\'\"CorruptionOne obvious way that Chinese companies have gotten around environmental and labor laws and maintained both a lack of accountability and transparency has been by bribing or otherwise paying off officials.In Jigawa, one of the poorest Nigerian states, Chinese businesses can with impunity seize land being farmed by community members because \"local politicians who have been bribed don\\'t care,\" notes Tijani Abdulkareem. \"Most of the officials have been bribed. In these states where there is high state of banditry, a Chinese businessman can bribe to get whatever he wants.\"The same applies to Nigerian businessmen who act on behalf of Chinese companies. One such businessman, nicknamed \"Dan China,\" presided over illegal mines that extracted $278 billion in lead, zinc, tin, and other ores. \"Protected by bribed security agents and local officials, Dan China allegedly smuggled the illegally mined ore to China via the port of Lagos,\" Abdulkareem recounts. In 2017, in an unusual anti-corruption effort, \"the Nigerian government cracked down on one of the largest of these illegal mining operations at Kampanin Zurak, a rural area about 150 miles outside the state capital, Jos. During the raid, police arrested sixteen Chinese nationals working at the remote site.\"In their eagerness to supply Chinese buyers, illegal loggers and fishers are deforesting Nigeria and depleting fishing supplies along the coast, again protected by local officials who have been bought off. Nigeria loses an estimated $70 million annually from illegal fishing alone. \"In July 2017, Sinopec-owned Addax paid $32 million to settle Swiss legal charges that the company had paid up to $100 million in bribes to Nigerian government officials via middlemen,\" Abdulkareem reports.Similar levels of corruption accompany mining operations in Guinea. In 2020, Israeli-French mining magnate Beny Steinmetz and two others stood accused in a Swiss court of paying $10 million in bribes to acquire access to the lucrative iron deposits in Guinea. Earlier corruption charges were dropped when Steinmetz relinquished the iron mining contracts. The government subsequently gave the contract to a Chinese-Singapore-Guinean joint venture, which has promised a rail link and a deep-water port to transport the ore to global markets.In Zimbabwe, the Chinese business owners \"give the impression that they are protected by someone in high office who has given them the permission to do what they please,\" Farai Maguwu reports. \"When communities oppose mines, the state will react, arresting Zimbabweans to protect the Chinese.\"Cultural ImpactMines and infrastructure projects don\\'t just have economic and environmental impact. They also have consequences for the social and cultural life of the communities where they are sited.In the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone in South Africa, for instance, \"the sacred animals and trees of the Venda people will be destroyed when making way for this project,\" says David Tshidzumba. \"They will exhume graves that are more than 60 years old, uproot trees sacred to indigenous people. Once you destroy the land, once you take away the water, we don\\'t have a sense of belonging. It\\'s not just heritage but also livelihood, our way of life.\"Mining projects in Zimbabwe have involved the appropriation of communal land, including drilling in gravesites. \"I don\\'t think there is anywhere in the world where there has been such a blatant violation of cultural rights as is happening in Zimbabwe,\" says Farai Maguwu. At one granite stone mining site, the Chinese company Heijin told villagers that the operation would go forward because they didn\\'t own the land. The Zimbabwean government, meanwhile, tried to downplay the number of villagers affected by the operation.Looking AheadCivil society activists have mounted campaigns against a variety of Chinese-financed extraction projects throughout Africa. They are pursuing legal strategies to prevent the Musina-Makhado zone from getting green-lighted. They are working with impacted communities to disseminate information about environmental impact, expose examples of corruption, and put pressure on governments to abide by local laws when dealing with Chinese companies. They want to establish greater transparency and accountability around Chinese projects and more durable mechanisms that can responsibly handle the complaints of workers and community members. And they are emphasizing non-extractive projects—sustainable agriculture, ecotourism, clean energy—that can provide comparable economic benefits without the devastating impact on the environment and the community.With Western firms, African activists can pursue actions against companies in the host country\\'s judicial system. But, China doesn\\'t have an independent judiciary. Corporate social responsibility became part of Chinese contract law in 2006 and entered into force in 2014, but companies don\\'t necessarily uphold such principles. Although Beijing established a court in 2018 under the authority of the Supreme People\\'s Court to handle international claims arising from the Belt and Road Initiative, it\\'s unclear how independent this judicial body will be.China is, however, increasingly concerned about its reputation. It has provided $60 billion in foreign aid and devoted $1 billion of its Belt and Road Initiative to African infrastructure. It wants to be seen as helping Africa not exploiting it.Recently, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo suspended a number of Chinese companies for illegal mining activities and Beijing responded by ordering the companies to leave the region and promising sanctions if the companies are found guilty of violations. This case demonstrates that the Chinese government is sensitive to public backlash.China has long maintained that it will not interfere with the sovereignty of the countries where it is economically involved. On this question of self-determination, then, African stakeholders perhaps have their greatest leverage. If they can publicize complaints, mobilize discontent, and persuade governments to take action, as in the DRC case, then China can be persuaded to change course, if not to uphold principles of corporate responsibility then to respect the sovereign will of the population and protect whatever remains of China\\'s international reputation.

       " 'By Annie CallawayAn Introduction from John PrendergastCobalt has rapidly emerged as an essential ingredient for some of world’s fastest-growing industries, with products ranging from electric cars to laptop computers to cell phones. The Democratic Republic of Congo (Congo) decisively dominates global cobalt supply. This could be a good news story, of how rapid technological innovations which drive demand for raw materials could potentially be an engine of development for a long-suffering country with the majority of the world’s supply of one of those critical raw materials.  Unfortunately, the story is beginning to unfold in a much different way, but it doesn’t have to.',\n",
       " 'Increasingly, cobalt production in Congo is tied to grand corruption which undermines peace and democracy in the country and along with copper are two of the main sources of funds for the violent kleptocracy that President Joseph Kabila presides over. Cobalt production in Congo is also marked by human rights abuses, including child labor at the mines, well documented by Amnesty International and others. Because of the devastating impact the sourcing of cobalt for the products we buy has on Congolese citizens, urgent action is required to shine a light on the insidious linkages in Congo’s cobalt trade, to help alter the incentive structure away from violence, corruption and human rights abuses and towards a transparent, peaceful and responsible supply chain.  Throughout 2017 and 2018, my colleagues at the Enough Project have conducted field and supply chain research on potential links between corruption, violence, human rights violations, and cobalt mining in Congo. As a result of this research, the Enough Project will be publishing two reports—this being the first—that highlight perspectives from the two ends of the supply chain.  This first report focuses on observations and recommendations from within Congo, including Congolese cobalt and copper miners in both the artisanal and industrial sectors, domestic traders, civil society activists, and local government representatives. We wanted to start by understanding the perspectives of those most impacted by the global cobalt trade. The second report will highlight the actions – current and potential – being taken by those profiting from and otherwise benefiting from Congo’s cobalt, including both companies and their customers.  Both reports will incorporate perspectives from stakeholders throughout the supply chain, because all of these stakeholders have distinct perspectives and needs, and the changes that are needed ultimately implicate all involved. This research is meant to serve as a complement to other studies on Congo’s cobalt sector conducted by colleague organizations such as Amnesty International, the Carter Center, and Global Witness.  It should be noted as well that cobalt mining occurs almost exclusively in tandem with or as a byproduct of copper mining. Copper is used in a wide variety of construction, transportation, defense technology, and machinery worldwide. In 2017, the National Mining Association reported that copper was the second most used mineral by the U.S. Department of Defense. Given this global industrial criticality, many of the contracts currently coveted for their cobalt production in Congo were first established mainly for their copper potential, before the surge in international demand for cobalt. Therefore, many of the findings and recommendations in this report can also be strategically applied to copper industry stakeholders in Congo and throughout the supply chain.  In addition to the reports, the Enough Project will also be launching an associated campaign to engage activists and consumers on policies that counter corruption, violence, and human rights abuses connected to Congo’s cobalt trade. The campaign will focus on highlighting opportunities for companies to become leaders on these issues, especially through the approaches to be detailed more thoroughly in the second report in this series.John Prendergast Founding Director Enough Project',\n",

It is even faster outside Harare because of smaller crowds and there is not too many law enforcement officials,\"The operation is quite sophisticated. The touts start by vetting their \\'prey\\' to avert any risk of being arrested either by the law enforcement agents or by members of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) who are deployed at the offices.A visit to the Bindura registrar\\'s office revealed that most of passport seekers there are mostly from Harare. One long distance haulage truck driver, Onesmo Zimuto, explained how he managed to have his passport renewed.\"My passport had run out of pages,\" said Zimuto. \"I had challenges renewing it in Harare because of the long queues. As I was about to give up when I was approached by one young man who referred me to this lady who works here. I submitted my papers on a Monday and on Thursday I collected my passport.\"I have since created a good working relationship with the lady. I am now processing this passport for my workmate whose passport is due to expire next month and is on duty in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"On my passport I paid US$250 including the fee for the middlemen. Because of the cordial relationship now existing I have now paid US$180. I have been told she will call me once it is out probably Thursday or Friday.\"Early this year, Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister, Kazembe Kazembe, was quoted in the media as having said that the Government was about to institute investigations.\"During my tour of the Bindura Passport Office,\" said Kazembe, \"I noticed that almost 90 percent of the people that were being assisted there had come from Harare.

       " '‘Everyone will be shocked.’Correspondent and Editor, AfricaInvestigations EditorA review of fraud and corruption risks in the Democratic Republic of Congo – one of the world’s longest-running humanitarian crises – delivers a blistering assessment that could spark major changes to aid operations in a country where hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid are spent annually.The 70-page draft review – circulated last month to aid officials working in Congo and obtained by The New Humanitarian – looks at everything from corruption within the Ebola response to how women and girls are subjected to sexual exploitation. It also details how donor funds are siphoned off and how aid recipients ultimately lose out.The office of UN Secretary-General António Guterres is aware of the review, spokeswoman Zoe Paxton told TNH. “Once the report is published, we will carefully consider any recommendations made,” she said.The operational review was commissioned by an anti-fraud taskforce created by UN agencies and aid groups in Congo after the NGO Mercy Corps discovered a fraud scheme in late 2018 –\\xa0first made public this week by TNH – that raised the alarm about widespread corruption and problems with the systems designed to root it out.\\xa0The review was shared with TNH by a senior aid official working in Congo who expressed dissatisfaction with how the humanitarian sector is managing fraud and corruption risks. It comes at a time when pressure on aid budgets around the world is set to rise due to a recession and the demands of COVID-19 sucking up cash reserves.Carried out by three international consultants and two Congolese researchers contracted by Adam Smith International, an aid consultancy – and funded with a grant from the UK\\'s government aid agency, DFID – the operational review, for which more than 400 people were interviewed, doesn’t take a position on the Mercy Corps case but confirms many of its findings.\\xa0It notes how networks of fraudsters have embedded themselves within humanitarian organisations and introduced a dizzying number of corrupt practices that impact everything from the recruitment of staff to the procurement of supplies and the delivery of aid. UN agencies in particular are cited.It also notes that the systems designed to detect fraud often fail, and that anti-corruption tools and guidelines are rarely used. Aid organisations are also reluctant to share information that could offer valuable lessons, it says.\\xa0“Learning from investigations is currently limited to the organisations themselves and their donors,” the document states. “Even for this review, lessons learned from such investigations have not been made available by donors or UN organisations.”While interviews for the review were held from January to April this year, it is unclear how long some of the practices it flags have been taking place.\\xa0“Everyone will be shocked,” said Joseph Inganji, the head of the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, OCHA, in Congo. He said the fraud noted in the review was distressing because the humanitarian sector was there to help and save lives.DFID, a major donor to humanitarian aid in Congo, said it had provided funding for the review because it is committed to tackling fraud and corruption, but refused to comment on the findings and recommendations until a final version is published later this month.Read how the UN reacted to this investigation →International aid analyst Charles Kenny of the Center for Global Development think tank cautioned that the review can’t tell the whole story.Relying on anecdotal information, it “doesn’t allow for an estimate of how pervasive corruption is in humanitarian relief aid in the DRC”, he said. Kenny told TNH he would value a follow-up survey of intended aid recipients to ask what they actually received.Diego Zorrilla, a senior UN official in Congo who works on the anti-fraud taskforce that commissioned the review, said the draft is not an exhaustive investigation but gives “clues of what could be happening”.Zorrilla said the review had only been circulated among members of the taskforce, and that he could not comment on how recommendations would be implemented before consulting the wider humanitarian community after a final version is submitted. Comments on specific findings were being sent back to the authors as part of the review process, he added.“This is not specific to the DRC. The only thing that is going to stop it is a systemic approach.”Asked about the broader situation – without mentioning the scam involving Mercy Corps or the draft review – Ernest Mpararo, of the Congolese League Against Corruption, blamed a “lack of monitoring and control” in humanitarian organisations for allowing fraud to spread, but pointed out that corruption is pervasive in Congo, where the president’s chief of staff is currently standing trial on graft charges.Other anti-corruption experts told TNH the draft review should be a wake-up call, not just for the aid sector in Congo but also for humanitarian organisations in other countries with long-running relief operations.“This is not specific to the DRC,” Tim Boyes-Watson at Humentum, an association that advises member NGOs, said after looking at the draft review provided by TNH. “The only thing that is going to stop it is a systemic approach.”Read our related investigation on the aid scam that spurred the review → EXCLUSIVE: Congo aid scam triggers sector-wide alarmResearcher Nisar Majid, of the London School of Economics, said the corruption described in the report was “very similar” to that found in his research on aid to Somalia.\\xa0“These issues shouldn\\'t be a surprise,” he said. However, “throughout the system, from top to bottom, we struggle to address it and talk about it.\"Corruption involving contracts between international aid groups and national NGOs is described in the report as particularly egregious, with local organisations sometimes expected to provide kickbacks that can amount to more than 10 percent of a contract value. Workers at UN agencies are most cited for being associated with the practice.One person interviewed for the review alleged that the selection committee of Congo’s humanitarian pooled fund –\\xa0a major pot run by OCHA – had demanded kickbacks from national NGOs in exchange for contracts.Inganji, the OCHA country director, described the allegation as “serious” but said the funding process is “transparent”. He said an investigation into the allegations had not yet been launched.“The end result of these pressures was described as reducing impact of aid for aid recipients, adding pressures to a difficult local market, and increasing food insecurity.”Allegations of corruption were also noted in procurement processes: interviewees told the review that suppliers “expect” to provide kickbacks to staff of NGOs and UN agencies of 10 to 30 percent of the contract value. Some suppliers said they had responded by fixing higher prices for aid groups.The seed sector appears to be particularly affected, according to people interviewed for the review who claimed that procurers often take a slice of the tonnage to sell privately. Insiders were said to replace seeds intended for distribution with lesser quality alternatives, the draft review notes, pointing to staff at UN agencies as among the worst offenders.“The end result of these pressures was described as reducing impact of aid for aid recipients, adding pressures to a difficult local market, and increasing food insecurity,” the review states.Representatives of national NGOs and suppliers told the review’s authors they believed that flagging corrupt practices would get them blocked from future contracts or partnerships with aid agencies. Both described a blacklist collectively enforced by some workers at different aid groups –\\xa0most often UN agencies – for those who “disturb the system”.Offering jobs in exchange for sex is “widely practiced” in the country, the review finds. There are also reports of aid recipients being expected to provide “sexual favours” for workers in exchange for their names being added to distribution lists.\\xa0Very few cases of sexual abuse and exploitation (SEA) involving aid workers, however, are ever reported – partially because hotlines and locked suggestion boxes meant for reporting abuse or corruption are ineffective.\\xa0“We hear a lot of talk – NGO and UN have zero tolerance policies; however, we do not see any consequences for [abusers] when they occur.”“[The complaints mechanisms] appear to produce no information with regards to occurring cases of sexual exploitation and abuse,” the review states, taking particular aim at the ineffectiveness of hotlines.One Congolese NGO staffer told the reviewers: “We hear a lot of talk – NGO and UN have zero tolerance policies; however, we do not see any consequences for [abusers] when they occur.”Women and girls, who “have neither access to [a] phone nor the privacy to use their husbands’ or family phone”, face particular challenges, the review notes.\\xa0It also highlights that perpetrators use “money, influence, and positions to keep survivors and their families quiet”, and are rarely punished.Survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation are often young – most often between 14 and 22 – and members of some of the most vulnerable communities in the country, including IDPs and orphans, the review notes. The authors recommend that more funding go to national organisations that work closely with survivors of abuse and gender-based violence.Ongoing corruption has caused a mutual lack of trust between the aid sector and local communities, who “perceive humanitarian aid as corrupt and driven by external agendas”, according to the draft review.\\xa0Similarly, aid groups have become equally jaded, the review suggests, hindering cooperation with local authorities and community leaders who regularly demand a share of project budgets.\\xa0In particular, the alert systems that are supposed to help communities report displacements to aid groups following conflicts or natural disasters pose a high risk of corruption, according to the document.Local leaders, authorities, and militia members can use the systems to fabricate population movements or exaggerate the number of people displaced – usually in collusion with staff members of aid organisations.\\xa0“This may lead to the allocation of aid in areas where it is either not needed, or less needed,” the review notes. “Consequently, vulnerable populations remain excluded and under-assisted and potential benefit is lost.”The UN’s Zorrilla said humanitarian organisations have improved their alert systems in recent months by introducing a process whereby data is more thoroughly analysed.Some IDPs who spoke to the authors reported having to pay bribes to be registered for aid, while those registered for support may receive reduced amounts, or no aid at all, the review says.Distrust between communities and relief workers has been\\xa0particularly pronounced in the Ebola-affected areas of Beni and Butembo, where vast sums of money have been pumped\\xa0into a single space, amplifying many of the underlying corruption risks described in the report.Interviewees told the review’s authors that vehicles belonging to staff of the Ebola response had been rented at “exceptionally” high prices, with cost negotiations sidelined for fast operationality. Military escorts had also been established “at very high costs”, the authors were told.The failure of existing systems to detect corruption and SEA have allowed both to flourish, the draft review concludes.The authors were told that aid workers tasked with evaluating project implementation are paid bribes to submit assessments that hide both corruption and poor performance.The review also notes that some of the corrupt practices appeared “audit proof” – the technique, for example, of “ghost” recipients is too hard to check. Those involved in audit processes could also potentially manipulate the results, the document states.Members of aid groups, meanwhile, described fraud reporting processes “as cumbersome and time-consuming”, with some lacking a dedicated compliance and anti-fraud department.\\xa0Despite recent improvements in information sharing – including the joint anti-fraud taskforce formed after the Mercy Corps case – the review’s authors note that organisations still don’t talk openly about attempted and confirmed cases of corruption.“There are too many vested interests; it\\'s a hugely complex industry.”Short funding cycles from donors, and an emphasis on speed – in the form of rapid response programmes – have “weakened” the overall quality of response and increased the opportunity for aid funds to be diverted, the review states.Communities, meanwhile, have built in-depth knowledge of the response mechanisms aid groups have used over the years, while the aid groups themselves often lack understanding of the local context and power dynamics.Majid, of the London School of Economics, said the corruption described in the report would require far more than “technical fixes” to solve. “There are too many vested interests; it\\'s a hugely complex industry,” he said.John Githongo, a Kenyan anti-corruption campaigner, said the “exploitation of the most vulnerable members of the population” was the most “disconcerting” finding of the review, which he read for TNH. He said DFID was courageous for having commissioned it, but added: “the real courage, of course, will be in doing something about it.”Additional reporting from Ben Parker in Geneva.pk-pd/bp/agSubscribe to our newsletters to stay up to date with our coverage.It was The New Humanitarian’s investigation with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that uncovered sexual abuse by aid workers during the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of Congo and led the World Health Organization to launch an independent review and reform its practices.This demonstrates the important impact that our journalism can have.\\xa0But this won’t be the last case of aid worker sex abuse. This also won’t be the last time the aid sector has to ask itself difficult questions about why justice for victims of sexual abuse and exploitation has been sorely lacking.\\xa0We’re already working on our next investigation, but reporting like this takes months, sometimes years, and can’t be done alone.The support of our readers and donors helps keep our journalism free and accessible for all.

Investigators from 18 countries, working with 19 media outlets and 5 nongovernmental organizations, spent months going through 3.5 million leaked documents to produce “Congo Hold-Up,” a stunning account of corruption under former president Joseph Kabila.The documents, obtained by Mediapart and the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa, are from BGFIBank Group (Banque Gabonaise et Française Internationale), a private bank allegedly used to channel millions of dollars’ worth of public funds to Kabila’s family and associates.Since November 19, “Congo Hold-Up” findings have been published almost daily, exposing a kleptocratic system that enabled the siphoning of state funds from Congo’s Central Bank, state-owned mining company Gecamines, the national electoral commission, and tax revenues.Kabila, his family, and close associates allegedly embezzled at least US$138 million dollars over five years between 2013 and 2018. They even allegedly stole United Nations payments intended for Congolese soldiers who contributed to peacekeeping operations in the Central African Republic.The trove of material also revealed evidence of fraud and bribery in Congo’s 2008 multi-billion dollar “deal of the century” with two Chinese state-owned mining companies. Sicomines, the joint venture formed to implement part of that deal, denied the allegations. Gecamines has not responded to the allegations.BGFI, in a statement released on November 24, decried the leak and questioned the authenticity of the documents, but “strongly condemn[ed] acts contrary to law and ethics that may have been committed in the past” within its Congo branch “and of which its employees could possibly have been perpetrators or complicit.”Although endemic corruption in Congo is common knowledge, the government’s lack of political will to investigate alleged wrongdoings and the opacity of financial operations have long enabled corrupt officials to enjoy impunity. However, with bank statements, contracts, emails, and transaction records on hand, “Congo Hold-Up” could provide sufficient evidence for prosecutions.Those responsible for financial crimes, as well as their international enablers, should be held accountable. In a country where one in three people is critically hungry and the government constantly neglects basic rights such as access to running water, electricity, health care, and education, justice for large-scale corruption is long overdue. \\xa0European Development Banks’ Link to Abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Palm Oil IndustryThe Impact of Lead Contamination on Children’s Rights in Kabwe, Zambia\",\n",

REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic/File PhotoBENI, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Congolese authorities on Wednesday sought to allay concerns about the arrival of Ugandan troops in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo for an ongoing joint operation against a militia linked to Islamic State.Witnesses saw hundreds of Ugandan soldiers entering Congo as both countries deployed special forces to secure bases of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia that they had hit with air and artillery strikes the previous day.  read more Government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said the countries were cooperating against a common enemy. The ADF are accused of killing hundreds of civilians in eastern Congo since 2019 and carrying out a string of recent bombings in Uganda.\"We know it is an operation that some of our fellow citizens have doubts about for good reasons,\" he told a news conference in the Kinshasa. \"Both we and Uganda have an obligation to act together.\"The move has provoked unease in both capitals because of the Ugandan army\\'s conduct during Congo\\'s 1998-2003 civil war, for which Kinshasa is seeking billions of dollars of reparations. Uganda has called the amount ruinous.  read more Army spokesman Leon-Richard Kasonga declined to say how many Ugandan troops were in Congo, how long the joint mission would last, or what toll had been exacted on the ADF.\"Patience,\" he told the briefing. \"We\\'ve just started.\"President Felix Tshisekedi had for months lobbied neighbours for help. His own efforts to end decades of bloodshed in Congo\\'s east have been stymied by poor planning, corruption and insufficient funding, according to a parliamentary report.  read more \"I have just seen 30 vehicles full of Ugandan soldiers entering Congo. I also saw two tanks,\" said Nobili resident Blaise Bokassa. Another witness, a civil rights activist, said he had seen \"many vehicles with hundreds of Ugandan soldiers\".A Ugandan army spokesperson said she could not immediately comment.Nelleke Van de Walle, from the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, said the operation appeared to be more ambitious than the last time Uganda attacked the ADF in Congo, in 2017, when it said it had killed 100 fighters in air strikes.Ugandan opposition lawmaker Joel Ssenyonyi said the government should have sought parliamentary permission for the deployment.\"We fear we could see the same illegal activities that happened during the past deployment - stealing gold and those other commodities.\"The ADF, which started as an uprising in Uganda but has been based in Congo since the late 1990s, pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2019.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Spencer Berry)JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-LACKLAND, Texas – In a unique and unprecedented ceremony, five military members from the Democratic Republic of Congo were promoted Nov. 2, at the Defense Language Institute English Language Center here.The five officers are currently enrolled in DLIELC’s Advanced English courses. Some are former students who have returned to further their training.Col. Rockie K Wilson, 37th Training Wing commander, presided over the ceremony.The following officers were promoted:1. Colonel Kani Wa Bahizi: Commandant of the Congolese Defense Language School and Senior Translator for the Minister of Defense and the Congolese Armed Forces\\' General Chief of Staff2. Colonel Mutombo Basaya: Senior Chief Military Prosecutor, Congolese Military Justice3. Lieutenant Colonel Kodiango Gangama: Training Officer/Instructor at the Congolese Defense Language School4. Lieutenant Kabanda Kasongo: Instructor, Congolese Defense Language School5. Lieutenant Muhemedi Numbi: Instructor, Congolese Defense Language School and translator for the Congolese Bureau of Military Cooperation“It’s an honor for us to be able to hold this ceremony for our Congolese students, whom have really gone above and beyond in their careers,” said Col. Joseph Schaefer, DLIELC Commandant. “This event exemplifies our growing relationship. We look forward to seeing how this partnership grows in the future.”Initially established in 1960, the diplomatic relations between the DRC and the United States support the DRC government in its efforts to combat corruption, uphold democratic processes, effectively govern, promote stability, and secure peace within the country and with its neighbors.The current U.S.-DRC bilateral relations were ushered in following the country’s December 2018 elections and peaceful transfer of power to President Felix Tshisekedi. This partnership was solidified in 2019 with the “Privileged Partnership for Peace and Prosperity,” a\\u202fjoint commitment to work together on areas of mutual concern. That same year the DRC joined the U.S. as part of the global coalition to defeat ISIS.The DLIELC is aligned under the 37 TRW and is a world-renowned institution in the field of English Language Training and, on average, has approximately 80 partner nations in residence at its JBSA-Lackland campus daily.Race to the FutureDangerous mining conditions plague Congo, home to the world’s largest supply of cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars. A leadership battle threatens reforms.The Kasulo cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Credit...Supported byBy Dionne Searcey and Eric LiptonPhotographs and Video by Ashley GilbertsonKASULO, Democratic Republic of Congo — A man in a pinstripe suit with a red pocket square walked around the edge of a giant pit one April afternoon where hundreds of workers often toil in flip-flops, burrowing deep into the ground with shovels and pickaxes.His polished leather shoes crunched on dust the miners had spilled from nylon bags stuffed with cobalt-laden rocks.The man, Albert Yuma Mulimbi, is a longtime power broker in the Democratic Republic of Congo and chairman of a government agency that works with international mining companies to tap the nation’s copper and cobalt reserves, used in the fight against global warming.Mr. Yuma’s professed goal is to turn Congo into a reliable supplier of cobalt, a critical metal in electric vehicles, and shed its anything-goes reputation for tolerating an underworld where children are put to work and unskilled and ill-equipped diggers of all ages get injured or killed. “We have to reorganize the country and take control of the mining sector,” said Mr. Yuma, who had pulled up to the Kasulo site in a fleet of SUVs carrying a high-level delegation to observe the challenges there.But to many in Congo and the United States, Mr. Yuma himself is a problem. As chairman of Gécamines, Congo’s state-owned mining enterprise, he has been accused of helping to divert billions of dollars in revenues, according to confidential State Department legal filings reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with a dozen current and former officials in both countries.Top State Department officials have tried to force him out of the mining agency and pushed for him to be put on a sanctions list, arguing he has for years abused his position to enrich friends, family members and political allies.Mr. Yuma denies any wrongdoing and is waging an elaborate lobbying and legal campaign to clear his name in Washington and Congo’s capital of Kinshasa, all while pushing ahead with his plans to overhaul cobalt mining.Effectively operating his own foreign policy apparatus, Mr. Yuma has hired a roster of well-connected lobbyists, wired an undisclosed $1.5 million to a former White House official, offered the United States purported intelligence about Russia and critical minerals and made a visit to Trump Tower in New York, according to interviews and confidential documents.Mr. Yuma met with Donald Trump Jr. there in 2018, a session the mining executive described as a quick meet-and-greet. Despite such high-level access during the Trump administration, he was barred just two months later from entering the United States.His grip on the mining industry has complicated Congo’s effort to attract new Western investors and secure its place in the clean energy revolution, which it is already helping to fuel with its vast wealth of minerals and metals like cobalt.Batteries containing cobalt reduce overheating in electric cars and extend their range, but the metal has become known as “the blood diamond of batteries” because of its high price and the perilous conditions in Congo, the largest producer of cobalt in the world. As a result, carmakers concerned about consumer blowback are rapidly moving to find alternatives to the element in electric vehicles, and they are increasingly looking to other nations with smaller reserves as possible suppliers.There is a chance that Congo’s role in the emerging economy could be diminished if it fails to confront human-rights issues in its mines. And even if Mr. Yuma works to resolve those problems, as he has pledged to do, it still may not be enough for new American investors who want to be assured the country has taken steps to curb a history of mining-industry corruption.Congo’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, has tried to sideline Mr. Yuma by stacking Gécamines with his own appointees, but he has been unwilling to cross him further. During an interview at his hillside palace in Kinshasa, Mr. Tshisekedi said he had his own strategy for fixing the country’s dangerous mining conditions.“It is not going to be up to Mr. Yuma,” he said. “It will be the government that will decide.”The standoff between Mr. Yuma and the president echoes power struggles that have torn apart African countries rich with natural resources in the past. How this one plays out has implications that reach far beyond the continent, as the global battle against climate change calls for a stepped-up transition from gasoline-burning vehicles to battery-powered ones.For Congo, the question boils down to this: Will Mr. Yuma help the country ride the global green wave into an era of new prosperity, or will he help condemn it to more strife and turmoil?Statues greet motorists at the main roundabout in a mining hub in Congo’s Copperbelt. One depicts an industrial miner in hard hat, headlamp and boots; another a shoeless, shirtless man in ragged shorts holding a pickax. They tell the story of the country’s dual mining economies: industrial and artisanal.High-tech, industrial mines run by global corporations like China Molybdenum employ thousands of people in Congo’s cobalt sector, and while they have their own problems, they are largely not responsible for the country’s tarnished reputation abroad.Players in the clean energy revolution are increasingly caught in a cycle of exploitation and greed over resources. At the center of it is the quest\\xa0for a prized metal: cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars.It’s a different story for the artisanal sector, where Mr. Yuma plans to focus the bulk of his stated reforms. Consisting of ordinary adults with no formal training, and sometimes even children, artisanal mining is mostly unregulated and often involves trespassers scavenging on land owned by the industrial mines. Along the main highway bisecting many of the mines, steady streams of diggers on motorbikes loaded down with bags of looted cobalt — each worth about $175 — dodge checkpoints by popping out of sunflower thickets.Unable to find other jobs, thousands of parents send their children in search of cobalt. On a recent morning, a group of young boys were hunched over a road running through two industrial mines, collecting rocks that had dropped off large trucks.The work for other children is more dangerous — in makeshift mines where some have died after climbing dozens of feet into the earth through narrow tunnels that are prone to collapse.Kasulo, where Mr. Yuma is showcasing his plans, illustrates the gold-rush-like fervor that can trigger the dangerous mining practices. The mine, authorized by Gécamines, is nothing more than a series of crude gashes the size of city blocks that have been carved into the earth.Once a thriving rural village, Kasulo became a mining strip after a resident uncovered chunks of cobalt underneath a home. The discovery set off a frenzy, with hundreds of people digging up their yards.Today, a mango tree and a few purple bougainvillea bushes, leftovers of residents’ gardens, are the only remnants of village life. Orange tarps tied down with frayed ropes block rainwater from flooding the hand-dug shafts where workers lower themselves and chip at the rock to extract chunks of cobalt.Georges Punga is a regular at the mine. Now 41, Mr. Punga said he started working in diamond mines when he was 11. Ever since, he has traveled the country searching Congo’s unrivaled storehouse for treasures underfoot: first gold, then copper, and, for the past three years, cobalt.Mr. Punga paused from his digging one afternoon and tugged his dusty blue trousers away from his sneakers. Scars crisscrossed his shins from years of injuries on the job. He earns less than $10 a day — just enough, he said, to support his family and keep his children in school instead of sending them to the mines.“If I could find another job, I’d do it,” he said. “I’m tired of digging.”On most days, hundreds of men trudge into this mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo wearing plastic headlamps and hoisting shovels in search of treasure underground: cobalt. Here’s the backstory →This pockmarked canyon was once a thriving village, until someone turned up a chunk of cobalt while doing construction around his home. It set off a frenzy for the metal, used in cellphones and electric vehicle batteries.The price of cobalt has skyrocketed in recent years, and the impact is clear in the cobalt-rich area near Kasulo. Trucks driving vats of chemicals rumble onto giant mines that produce hundreds of thousands of tons of ore.But regular people, and sometimes children, also grab a pickax and start digging. They’re known as artisanal miners, as opposed to industrial miners.Artisanal work can be dangerous, especially when deep tunnels collapse. Some people trespass on massive industrial mines, stealing the rocks they uncover and selling them at makeshift depots to international traders.The government of Congo is trying to clean up artisanal mining, formalizing mine sites with better safety rules and protections for workers. Some automakers and other corporations have also made safety pledges.For now, artisanal mining remains a huge part of the industry. As much as 30 percent of Congo’s cobalt production comes from artisanal mining. And it’s unclear whether Congo’s plans for reform will turn into reality.Read about the man leading Congo’s reform effort.Officials in Congo have begun taking corrective steps, including creating a subsidiary of Gécamines to try to curtail the haphazard methods used by the miners, improve safety and stop child labor, which is already illegal.Under the plan, miners at sites like Kasulo will soon be issued hard hats and boots, tunneling will be forbidden and pit depths will be regulated to prevent collapses. Workers will also be paid more uniformly and electronically, rather than in cash, to prevent fraud.As chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Yuma is at the center of these reforms. That leaves Western investors and mining companies that are already in Congo little choice but to work with him as the growing demand for cobalt makes the small-scale mines — which account for as much as 30 percent of the country’s output — all the more essential.Once the cobalt is mined, a new agency will buy it from the miners and standardize pricing for diggers, ensuring the government can tax the sales. Mr. Yuma envisions a new fund to offer workers financial help if cobalt prices decline.Right now, diggers often sell the cobalt at a mile-long stretch of tin shacks where the sound of sledgehammers smashing rocks drowns out all other noise. There, international traders crudely assess the metal’s purity before buying it, and miners complain of being cheated.Mr. Yuma led journalists from The Times on a tour of Kasulo and a nearby newly constructed warehouse and laboratory complex intended to replace the buying shacks.“We are going through an economic transition, and cobalt is the key product,” said Mr. Yuma, who marched around the pristine but yet-to-be-occupied complex, showing it off like a proud father.Seeking solutions for the artisanal mining problem is a better approach than simply turning away from Congo, argues the International Energy Agency, because that would create even more hardships for impoverished miners and their families.But activists point out that Mr. Yuma’s plans, beyond spending money on new buildings, have yet to really get underway, or to substantially improve conditions for miners. And many senior government officials in both Congo and the United States question if Mr. Yuma is the right leader for the task — openly wondering if his efforts are mainly designed to enhance his reputation and further monetize the cobalt trade while doing little to curb the child labor and work hazards.Bottles of Dom Pérignon were chilling on ice beside Mr. Yuma as he sat in his Gécamines office, where chunks of precious metals and minerals found in Congo’s soil were encased in glass. He downed an espresso before his interview with The Times, surrounded by contemporary Congolese art from his private collection. His lifestyle, on open display, was clear evidence, he said, that he need not scheme or steal to get ahead.“I was 20 years old when I drove my first BMW in Belgium, so what are we talking about?” he said of allegations that he had pilfered money from the Congolese government.Mr. Yuma is one of Congo’s richest businessmen. He secured a prime swath of riverside real estate in Kinshasa where his family set up a textile business that holds a contract to make the nation’s military uniforms. A perpetual flashy presence, he is known for his extravagance. People still talk about his daughter’s 2019 wedding, which had the aura of a Las Vegas show, with dancers wearing light-up costumes and large white giraffe statues as table centerpieces.He has served on the board of Congo’s central bank and was re-elected this year as president of the country’s powerful trade association, the equivalent of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.The huge mining agency where he is chairman was nationalized and renamed under President Mobutu Sese Seko after Congo gained independence from Belgium in 1960. Gécamines once had a monopoly on copper and cobalt mining and, by the 1980s, was among the top copper producers in the world. Jobs there offered a good salary, health care and schooling for employees’ families.But Mobutu, who ruled for 32 years, raided its funds to support himself and his cronies, a pattern followed by his successors, according to anti-corruption groups. By the 1990s, production from Gécamines had declined dramatically. Money wasn’t reinvested into operations, and the agency amassed debt of more than $1 billion. Eventually, half of its work force was laid off.To survive, Gécamines was restructured, turning to joint ventures with private, mostly foreign, investors in which the agency had a minority stake.Mr. Yuma took over in 2010, promising to return Gécamines to its former glory. But instead, according to anti-corruption groups, mining revenues soon disappeared. The Carter Center, a nonprofit, estimated that between 2011 and 2014 alone some $750 million vanished from Gécamines’ coffers, placing the blame in part on Mr. Yuma.The winners of Gécamines’ partnership deals under Mr. Yuma included Dan Gertler, a billionaire diamond dealer from Israel. Mr. Gertler was later put under U.S. sanctions for “hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals,” according to the Treasury Department.A confidential investigative report that was submitted to the State Department and Treasury and obtained by The Times accuses Mr. Yuma of nepotism, holding stakes in textile and food-importing businesses that got funding from a government agency he helped oversee, and steering work to a mining contractor in which he was alleged to have shares.American authorities also believed that Mr. Yuma was using some of the mining-sector money to help prop up supporters of Joseph Kabila, the kleptocratic president of Congo for 18 years who had first put him in charge of Gécamines.“Suspicious financial transactions appeared to coincide with the country’s electoral cycles,” said the State Department’s 2018 annual report on human rights in Congo, crediting the Carter Center for the research.By his own tally, Mr. Yuma has been accused of cheating Congo out of some $8.8 billion, an amount he thinks is absurd, saying he has brought in billions of dollars in revenue to the country.Mr. Yuma has launched a bombastic counterattack on watchdog groups and his critics, calling them “new colonialists.” He has claimed that they somehow conspired with mining companies to stymie his efforts to revamp the industry, which, in his assessment, has left “the Congolese population in a form of modern slavery.”Mr. Yuma also sent The Times a 33-page document outlining his defense, noting the many “veritable smear campaigns that seek to sully his reputation and blur his major role in favor of the country through the reform of its mining policy.”The room was packed. Top White House and State Department officials, mining executives, Senate staffers and other Washington elites sat rapt one day in 2018 at the D.C. headquarters of a foreign policy group as the microphone was handed to the guest of honor: Mr. Yuma.“We understand President Donald Trump’s desire to diversify and secure the U.S. supply chain,” he said, speaking to the Atlantic Council. “It would be of our best interests to consider partnerships with American companies to develop projects for the supply of these minerals.”Accused at home of pillaging the country’s revenues, Mr. Yuma had taken his image-cleansing campaign abroad, seeking redemption by convincing Washington that he was a critical link to Congo’s minerals and metals.Mr. Yuma’s team of lobbyists and lawyers included Joseph Szlavik, who had served in the White House under President George Bush, and Erich Ferrari, a prominent sanctions lawyer.Lodging at the Four Seasons, he held meetings on two trips that spring with officials from the World Bank and the Departments of Defense, Energy and the Interior. He also traveled to New York, where he met with Donald Trump Jr.There, he was accompanied by Gentry Beach, a Texas hedge fund manager who was a major campaign fund-raiser for the former president as well as a close friend and erstwhile business partner of the younger Mr. Trump. Mr. Beach has been trying to secure a mining deal in Congo, and was previously invested with Mr. Trump in a mining project there. He did not respond to requests for comment.“Someone wanted to introduce me to say hello,” Mr. Yuma said, playing down the exchange with the president’s son.Mr. Trump said he did not recall the meeting.Through all the encounters, Mr. Yuma said, he recited the same message: American needed him, and he was ready to help.In Washington, he even offered what he considered crucial intelligence about Russia’s efforts to acquire Congolese niobium, a shiny white metal that resists corrosion and can handle super-high temperatures like those found in fighter jet engines. Mr. Yuma said he had helped thwart the sale to benefit the United States, according to two American officials involved in the meeting.Signs of trouble emerged during one of the trips. A member of his lobbying team was pulled aside by a State Department official and given a stark warning. Mr. Yuma was now a target of a corruption investigation by the United States, and he was about to be punished.A few weeks later, in June 2018, the State Department formally prohibited him from returning to the United States.“Today’s actions send a strong signal that the U.S. government is committed to fighting corruption,” the State Department said in a statement at the time that did not name Mr. Yuma, and instead said the actions involved “several senior” officials from Congo, which The Times confirmed included Mr. Yuma.For Mr. Yuma, the action signaled that he needed even more muscle. He would hire Herman Cohen, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs under Mr. Bush, and George Denison, who had worked for President Gerald Ford.A former Congolese airline and telephone executive named Joseph Gatt, who lives in Virginia and is close to Mr. Yuma, also took up his cause. Mr. Gatt stationed a personal aide at the Fairmont, a luxury hotel about a mile from the White House, who organized meetings with the lobbyists to push for permission for Mr. Yuma to visit the United States.“He’s a very formidable person,” Mr. Gatt said of Mr. Yuma in an interview, insisting that the allegations against him were false and that he was “quite clean.”At the same time, Mr. Yuma worked on elevating his standing in Congo. He hatched a plan with the exiting president, Mr. Kabila: Mr. Yuma would act as his proxy by becoming prime minister, State Department officials told The Times.But a top American diplomat was sent to meet with Mr. Yuma at his home in Kinshasa to make clear that the United States strongly objected to the plan, according to an interview with the diplomat, J. Peter Pham. After pulling out a bottle of Cristal Champagne, Mr. Yuma talked with Mr. Pham about political events in Congo, but things soon turned sour.Mr. Pham, then a special envoy to the region, told Mr. Yuma that the Americans were prepared to deport two of his daughters, who were completing graduate degrees in the United States, if he pursued Mr. Kabila’s scheme.“If we revoked your visa, we could revoke theirs,” Mr. Pham recalled telling Mr. Yuma.Mr. Yuma was undeterred, and his team recruited an aide to Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, to deliver an invitation for Mr. Yuma to visit the United States and discuss his work in Congo. The invitation was even shared with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, though the State Department shut it down. “We saw it for what it was: an attempt to get around the visa ban,” Mr. Pham said.Still determined to get his way, Mr. Yuma bolstered his collection of influencers. Mr. Denison briefly joined the Washington lobbying team with instructions to ensure that Mr. Yuma could travel to the United States and that he “not face legal sanctions,” a June 2020 email shows. The United States was considering putting Mr. Yuma on a sanctions list, according to State Department officials, a move that could freeze money he had in international banks.But a $3 million contract between the men did not mention that assignment, instead saying that Mr. Denison was to “promote the attractiveness of the business climate” in Congo, according to a copy of the document.Shortly after he started the work, Mr. Denison received $1.5 million, emails show, with instructions to transfer most of it to an account belonging to an associate of Mr. Yuma’s. The transaction drew scrutiny from the bank — and alarm bells went off for Mr. Denison, who said he was concerned that he might be unknowingly participating in a money-laundering scheme.Mr. Denison hired a lawyer, quit the job and ultimately returned all the funds.“He’s a huge crook,” Mr. Denison said.Mr. Yuma did not respond to a question on the matter.President Tshisekedi and Mr. Yuma walked near a large terraced canyon at one of Glencore’s cobalt mines in the Copperbelt, a region so defined by mining that roadside markets sell steel-toed boots and hard hats alongside fresh eggs and spears of okra.The outing in May was awkward for these two political rivals.Mr. Tshisekedi, a longtime opposition member who took office in early 2019 in a disputed election, has been fully embraced by the Biden administration, which sees him as an ally in battling global warming. He is chairman of the African Union and has repeatedly appeared with Mr. Biden at international events, including a meeting in Rome last month and then again a few days later in Glasgow at the global climate conference.Back home, Mr. Tshisekedi has announced that he intends to make Congo “the world capital for strategic minerals.” But some Congolese and American officials think that in order for that to happen, Mr. Yuma needs to be ousted.“We have continuously tried to apply pressure” to have Mr. Yuma removed, said one State Department official. Yet Mr. Yuma “retains considerable influence,” the official said, baffling the State Department.Meanwhile, Mr. Yuma is carrying on as usual, trailed by an entourage of aides who address him as President Yuma, as he is known throughout much of Congo for his business leadership. It is also a nod to his power base and ambitions.He talks of installing seven new floors and a helipad at his office building in downtown Kinshasa. He even had one of his lobbyists track down Mr. Tshisekedi in September in New York, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting, to press him to stand by Mr. Yuma.In Congo, Mr. Yuma also embarked on a nationwide tour this year that looked a lot like a campaign for public office. He set out to visit every province, strategically making his first stop in Mr. Tshisekedi’s hometown, where he met with a group of struggling pineapple juice sellers.Before leaving, he handed the group $5,000 in cash to jump-start their business.“Just to show them that I’m supportive,” he explained in an interview.Like the president, Mr. Yuma is hoping to get credit for attracting more U.S. investors, convinced that his reform efforts will turn the tide.“I’m a friend of America,” he said in the interview. “I always work in good will to protect and to help the U.S. invest in D.R.C. And I told you, I love America. My children were at university there. One of these days, people will understand I’m a real good friend of America and I will continue to help.”If his success depends on transforming the mining sector, the task will be formidable.All day long on a main highway that runs through dozens of industrial mines, trucks groan with loads of copper and tubs of chemicals used to extract metals from ore.But snaking between them is motorcycle after motorcycle, with one man driving and one sitting backward, acting as a lookout, atop huge bags of stolen cobalt.Dionne Searcey reported from Kasulo, and Eric Lipton from Washington. Michael Forsythe contributed reporting from New York.AdvertisementKINSHASA“I CONSIDER MYSELF to be like a mosquito,” says Bob Elvis, a musician, from his studio in downtown Kinshasa, the sprawling capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. “I may be small but I can annoy you all night long, by singing, biting and not leaving you alone.”Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Mr Elvis’s latest rap song, “Letter to Ya Tshitshi”, has rankled the president of Congo, Félix Tshisekedi, so much that it was banned days after being released. The song addresses Étienne Tshisekedi, the president’s dead father, a firebrand opposition leader, by his nickname. It laments his son’s incompetence.In the video, Mr Elvis raps to a photo of Mr Tshisekedi senior, surrounded by flickering candles. He repeats the refrain “since you left” and describes the country’s woes, from the scarcity of clean water to the abundance of corruption, electoral fraud and conflict. “Since you left, war in the east goes on,” he raps. “We are fighting for the rule of law.”The Censorship Commission banned another six of Mr Elvis’s songs as well as a track called “What we have not done” by MPR, a hip-hop group. This song is about the failings of every Congolese president since independence. The ban on MPR’s track was rescinded a day later when fans kicked up a fuss.Mr Elvis has not been so lucky. Broadcasters that play his forbidden tracks risk having their licences revoked. Other musicians have been targeted, too. A rapper from southern Congo, Sébastien Lumbwe, known as “Infrapa”, fled the country two weeks ago after being harassed by officials over his songs, which poke the government. “It is part of a pattern of shrinking civic space,” says Jean-Mobert Senga of Amnesty International, a watchdog. “It goes against President Tshisekedi’s commitment to respect human rights.”The legal authority to ban the songs comes from a decree issued by a crooked dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, 54 years ago. The current president’s father, were he still alive, would be appalled. He spent much of his life campaigning against Mobutu’s champagne-gargling tyranny. Now his son is using the kleptocrat’s diktat to stifle dissidents of his father’s sort, albeit funkier.Still, the Congolese government has not yet figured out how to make censorship effective in an age of social media. Although Mr Elvis says he is incensed by the ban, he is probably quite pleased about the buzz it has created. “Letter to Ya Tshitshi” has received more than four times as many hits on YouTube as some of his other recent tracks. It sounds tinnier played out of mobile phones than on the radio, but at least it is not a flop. Unlike the government that banned it.This article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \"Zapping the rap\"A daily newsletter with the best of our journalismThe digital revolution will be grounded in fibre, steel and concreteThe podium celebration will be under heavy scrutinyChina’s lending is slowing, even as the West is promising moreThe digital revolution will be grounded in fibre, steel and concreteThe podium celebration will be under heavy scrutinyChina’s lending is slowing, even as the West is promising moreThe unrest is a reminder of what the country could gain from a dealSouth Africans feel unjustly punished for their country’s scientific rigourPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” Copyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2021.

Now a Chinese mining conglomerate has bought it, and is racing to retrieve its buried treasure: millions of tons of cobalt.At 73, Kyahile Mangi has lived here long enough to predict the path ahead. Once the blasting starts, the walls of mud-brick homes will crack. Chemicals will seep into the river where women do laundry and dishes while worrying about hippo attacks. Soon a manager from the mine will announce that everyone needs to be relocated.“We know our ground is rich,” said Mr. Mangi, a village chief who also knows residents will share little of the mine’s wealth.This wooded stretch of southeast Democratic Republic of Congo, called Kisanfu, holds one of the largest and purest untapped reserves of cobalt in the world.The gray metal, typically extracted from copper deposits, has historically been of secondary interest to miners. But demand is set to explode worldwide because it is used in electric-car batteries, helping them run longer without a charge.Outsiders discovering — and exploiting — the natural resources of this impoverished Central African country are following a tired colonial-era pattern. The United States turned to Congo for uranium to help build the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and then spent decades, and billions of dollars, seeking to protect its mining interests here.Now, with more than two-thirds of the world’s cobalt production coming from Congo, the country is once again taking center stage as major automakers commit to battling climate change by transitioning from gasoline-burning vehicles to battery-powered ones. The new automobiles rely on a host of minerals and metals often not abundant in the United States or the oil-rich Middle East, which sustained the last energy era.But the quest for Congo’s cobalt has demonstrated how the clean energy revolution, meant to save the planet from perilously warming temperatures in an age of enlightened self-interest, is caught in a familiar cycle of exploitation, greed and gamesmanship that often puts narrow national aspirations above all else, an investigation by The New York Times found.The Times dispatched reporters across three continents drawn into the competition for cobalt, a relatively obscure raw material that along with lithium, nickel and graphite has gained exceptional value in a world trying to set fossil fuels aside.More than 100 interviews and thousands of pages of documents show that the race for cobalt has set off a power struggle in Congo, a storehouse of these increasingly prized resources, and lured foreigners intent on dominating the next epoch in global energy.In particular, a rivalry between China and the United States could have far-reaching implications for the shared goal of safeguarding the earth. At least here in Congo, China is so far winning that contest, with both the Obama and Trump administrations having stood idly by as a company backed by the Chinese government bought two of the country’s largest cobalt deposits over the past five years.As the significance of those purchases becomes clearer, China and the United States have entered a new “Great Game” of sorts. This past week, during a visit promoting electric vehicles at a General Motors factory in Detroit, President Biden acknowledged the United States had lost some ground. “We risked losing our edge as a nation, and China and the rest of the world are catching up,” he said. “Well, we’re about to turn that around in a big, big way.”Where Clean Energy Metals Are ProducedProduction of key resources is highly concentrated today.

In response, the United States is pressing for access to cobalt supplies from allies, including Australia and Canada, according to a national security official with knowledge of the matter.American automakers like Ford, General Motors and Tesla buy cobalt battery components from suppliers that depend in part on Chinese-owned mines in Congo. A Tesla longer-range vehicle requires about 10 pounds of cobalt, more than 400 times the amount in a cellphone.Already, tensions over minerals and metals are rattling the electric vehicle market.Deadly rioting in July near a port in South Africa, where much of Congo’s cobalt is exported to China and elsewhere, caused a global jump in the metal’s prices, a surge that only worsened through the rest of the year.Last month, the mining industry’s leading forecaster said the rising cost of raw materials was likely to drive up battery costs for the first time in years, threatening to disrupt automakers’ plans to attract customers with competitively priced electric cars.Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, said the mineral supply crunch needed to be confronted.“We have to solve these things,” he said at an event in September, “and we don’t have much time.”Automakers like Ford are spending billions of dollars to build their own battery plants in the United States, and are rushing to curb the need for newly mined cobalt by developing lithium iron phosphate substitutes or turning to recycling. As a result, a Ford spokeswoman said, “we do not see cobalt as a constraining issue.”Increased mining and refining of cobalt by Chinese companies has helped meet the growing demand and advanced the fight against climate change. But as more electric vehicles are produced by more automakers worldwide, the International Energy Agency expects a cobalt shortage by 2030, based on an analysis of existing mines and those under construction. Other forecasters say a shortage could hit as soon as 2025.The worldwide shift to electric vehicles is critical in the fight against climate change. Come along as the most important part of these cars, the battery, is made from components around the world → It all starts with metals and minerals. Prized cobalt mostly comes from mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Nickel is largely gathered in Indonesia and the Philippines; lithium in Argentina, Australia and Chile. The metals and other ingredients are\\xa0 used to make the battery’s electrodes.Much of this work is done in China, which is far ahead of the U.S. in building batteries. A Tesla Model Y, in one recent configuration, had 4,416 battery cells, which it makes at its so-called Gigafactories in the U.S. The battery cells represent nearly one-third of the car’s cost.American automakers like GM often buy battery cells from a South Korean-based supplier, though they are trying to move manufacturing to the U.S. But the minerals needed to make them will continue to depend on overseas supply.Read more about the clean energy revolution and the race between the U.S. and China to secure key resources.A review by The Times of documents filed with regulatory authorities in China shows the acquisitions in Congo have followed a disciplined playbook, announced with great fanfare by Beijing in 2015, to dominate the world’s emerging clean energy economy.As of last year, 15 of the 19 cobalt-producing mines in Congo were owned or financed by Chinese companies, according to a data analysis by The Times and Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The biggest alternative to Chinese operators is Glencore, a Switzerland-based company that runs two of the largest cobalt mines there.These Chinese companies have received at least $12 billion in loans and other financing from state-backed institutions, and are likely to have drawn billions more. In fact, the five biggest Chinese mining companies in Congo had lines of credit from state-backed banks that totaled $124 billion, according to the documents reviewed by The Times, even though one of them, China Molybdenum, described itself as “a pure business entity” traded on two stock exchanges.China’s goal is to control the global supply chain from the metals in the ground to the batteries themselves, no matter where the vehicles are made. The approach, in part, echoes Henry Ford’s investments in Amazonian rubber plantations as the auto industry turned to mass production in the early 20th century.The forested mine site at Kisanfu was just one of two major purchases in recent years by China Molybdenum. The first came in 2016, when it took control of Tenke Fungurume, a mine that on its own produces twice as much cobalt as any other country in the world. At least $1.59 billion of the $2.65 billion Tenke Fungurume price tag, financial records show, came from loans provided by Chinese state-owned banks.Players in the clean energy revolution are increasingly caught in a cycle of exploitation and greed over resources. At the center of it is the quest\\xa0for a prized metal: cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars.As the Chinese were stepping up their focus on green energy in 2016, the soon-to-be U.S. president, Donald J. Trump, was extolling the fossil fuel industry, campaigning in West Virginia with a hard hat and shovel and falsely promising coal miners that “you’re going to be working your asses off!” After taking office, Mr. Trump would roll back requirements on American automakers intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, giving the Chinese an even wider lane.“It is pretty heartbreaking what happened here,” said Nicole Widdersheim, who worked on Africa issues for the National Security Council during the Trump administration. “Just so stupid.”The frenzy for Congo’s cobalt has attracted an international cast of opportunists, luminaries and shadowy characters eager to benefit. At one point, it also drew in a Chinese-based private equity firm that Hunter Biden helped found and that was later scrutinized in the 2020 presidential campaign.At the same time, Chinese companies are running into new headwinds from Congo’s government, according to documents obtained by The Times and interviews with current and former senior U.S. officials.Congolese officials are carrying out a broad review of past mining contracts, work they are doing with financial help from the American government as part of its broader anti-corruption effort. They are examining whether companies are fulfilling their contractual obligations, including a 2008 commitment from China to deliver billions of dollars’ worth of new roads, bridges, power plants and other infrastructure.Congo’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, in August named a commission to investigate allegations that China Molybdenum, the company that bought the two Freeport-McMoRan properties, might have cheated the Congolese government out of billions of dollars in royalty payments. The company risks being expelled from Congo.At the Tenke Fungurume mine, there have long been problems associated with trespassers from nearby villages scavenging for cobalt. After China Molybdenum called on the government to help, Congolese troops fired on a trespasser inside the mine’s gates, killing him, as well as a second person who was shot after riots broke out in protest, witnesses and local officials told The Times.Separately, at least a dozen employees or contractors at the mine told The Times that Chinese ownership had led to a drastic decline in safety and an increase in injuries, many of which were not reported to management. Two Congolese safety officers said workers were assaulted after they raised concerns and were offered bribes to cover up accidents.“Things are falling apart in terms of safety,” said Alfred Kiloko Makeba, who retired last year after a decade working as a safety supervisor at the mine.Vincent Zhou, a spokesman for China Molybdenum, rejected claims that the company had cheated the Congolese government or relaxed safety standards, saying the opposite was true, and questioned if there was an organized effort to undermine the company.China has an idiom that goes something like: “Where there is a will to condemn, evidence will follow,” Mr. Zhou said in a written response to The Times. “Vaguely I feel that we may be caught in the gaming of greater powers.”African countries for years have been turning to China for help building infrastructure with loans or trades involving their natural resources — deals that analysts warn provide far more benefit to the Chinese.A blueprint for those deals, now common across the continent, was sketched out in 2005 when Joseph Kabila walked into the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Mr. Kabila, then just 33, was the new president of Congo after the assassination of his father, another tragic milepost on the poverty-stricken country’s road of violence and political disruption.China was familiar territory for Mr. Kabila, who had received military training there in the late 1990s. This visit was about enlisting the help of President Hu Jintao in turning around Congo’s economy.The United States, which had long provided economic and military assistance to Congo, was locked in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and had become increasingly uninterested in the country. Congo’s poor record on graft and human rights was also scaring away many international banks and Western investors.Mr. Kabila’s wish list was long: He wanted new roads, schools and hospitals as part of a revival plan that, he hoped, would endear him back home to a nation exhausted and dispirited by years of conflict and corruption.In exchange, he was prepared to offer up his country’s vast mineral wealth — unparalleled in much of the world.In the imposing hall on Tiananmen Square, the two presidents outlined a deal that would change Central Africa’s balance of power, according to André Kapanga, a former adviser to Mr. Kabila who offered details of the meeting for the first time in an interview with The Times.Mr. Hu explained that many people in China’s western provinces lived in deep poverty. Developing the area was a cornerstone of his domestic policy, and he needed minerals and metals to build out new industries. Congo was ready to help, Mr. Kabila assured him.China had already acquired raw materials from Congo’s neighbor, Angola, where it offered generous financial support in exchange for oil.But this potential deal with Mr. Kabila was more ambitious than any other, and a diplomatic drama would play out at the riverside Palais de la Nation in the capital of Kinshasa before it was sealed.The setting was Mr. Kabila’s inauguration in 2006, after he stood before voters in a formal election and won the presidency. The Bush administration sent a delegation led by Elaine Chao, then the secretary of labor.Mr. Kabila liked motorcycles, and she presented him with a Harley-Davidson trinket when she greeted him at a lunch. That would be the extent of their interaction, Ms. Chao believed, but members of her delegation urged her to ask for a private meeting, according to Laura Genero, an associate deputy labor secretary who was on the trip. To her surprise, Mr. Kabila complied with a meeting the next day.Ms. Chao was so unprepared for the invitation that she had to borrow a beige pantsuit from Ms. Genero. She had packed just one work outfit.The U.S. delegation congratulated Mr. Kabila on his democratic victory and listened as he talked about wanting to expand access to electricity across the nation. One of his aides characterized the meeting as mostly small talk.But a similar meeting between the new president and Chinese officials played out differently, according to Mr. Kapanga, who was briefed on both the U.S. and Chinese discussions.The Chinese used the opportunity to begin formal talks with Mr. Kabila that would result in a $6 billion agreement: China would pay for roads, hospitals, rail lines, schools and projects to expand electricity, all in exchange for access to 10 million tons of copper and more than 600,000 tons of cobalt.The local media called it the “the deal of the century,” and while Mr. Kabila celebrated the agreement, the global financial community reacted more warily, worried Congo was taking on too much debt.American officials marveled at the deal’s historic scale. In secret cables made public by WikiLeaks, they noted that previous Chinese investment in Congo had been “an informal, somewhat disorganized collection of Chinese businesses” that did not seriously threaten U.S. interests.Now something much grander was in the making: “2,000 miles of roadway linking Orientale and Katanga provinces, 31 hospitals, 145 health centers, two large universities and 5,000 government housing units are pledged,” according to a cable in 2008 from the U.S. embassy in Kinshasa to members of the Central Intelligence Agency, the secretary of state and other officials.“And that’s not all,” the cable continued.By 2015, China’s presence in Congo had become visible in numerous infrastructure projects: Soccer stadiums rose from the dust, roadways were expanded, work began on water treatment facilities.But not all of its progress in cornering the cobalt market could be measured in brick and mortar. The Chinese ambassador at the time, Wang Tongqing, kicked off an American-style diplomatic blitz.Mr. Wang threw out the jump ball that year at a Chinese corporate basketball tournament that drew Congolese spectators.He gave out scholarships to Congolese students to study in China and was on hand when a Chinese organization donated plane tickets for a Congolese choir to tour his country. At one point, he offered $1 million for Ebola relief in Congo.Mr. Wang’s activities coincided with the 2015 rollout of his country’s “Made in China 2025” policy, which detailed China’s plan to transform itself into a “manufacturing superpower” in 10 areas, including batteries for electric vehicles.Almost instantly a tidal wave of government-backed capital poured into Chinese companies in Congo and elsewhere. Deals quickly followed.That year, the state-owned China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group said it would partner with Congo’s state mining company, Gécamines, to develop the Deziwa site, then one of the largest copper and cobalt concessions in the country.In 2017, Zijin Mining, a Chinese state-backed company with a slogan of “Harmony Begets Wealth,” raised almost $700 million from a sale of private shares to develop its Kolwezi mine.Public statements about the deals signaled some of China’s ambition, but the history and scale of the effort have not been previously reported.Corporate filings, including annual reports and bond prospectuses, examined by The Times show that the five biggest Chinese companies in Congo had been given at least $124 billion in credit lines for their global operations. All of the companies are state-owned or have significant minority stakes held by various levels of the Chinese government.“Unlike the U.S., the Chinese government is always behind Chinese investors in Africa and more specifically in D.R.C.,” said Mr. Kapanga, the former adviser to Mr. Kabila.The biggest deal came in April 2016, when China Molybdenum, a company whose biggest shareholders are a government-owned company and a reclusive billionaire, made its $2.65 billion offer to buy Tenke Fungurume, an American-owned mine atop one of the biggest cobalt reserves in the world.There was one complication. Freeport-McMoRan had a Canadian partner that had the right of first offer to buy its stake. China Molybdenum’s solution was to have a Shanghai-based private equity firm buy out the partner, but even that deal relied on money from the Chinese government.None of the $1.14 billion raised to buy the partner’s share came from private investors, company filings show. Instead, it came from Chinese state-controlled entities, including from bank loans guaranteed by China Molybdenum as well as cash brought to the deal through obscure shell companies controlled by government-owned banks, according to the filings.The board of the private equity firm, commonly known as BHR, was dominated by Chinese members but also included three Americans: Devon Archer, a businessman who later was convicted of defrauding the Oglala Sioux tribe in a case still working through the legal system, and James Bulger, son of the former president of the Massachusetts State Senate.Another was Hunter Biden, whose father was vice president at the time.It is not clear if Mr. Biden, who had helped found the firm in 2013, was involved in the deal. Mr. Biden did not respond to requests for comment. A former member of the BHR board, who was not authorized to speak about internal business matters, said that none of the Americans had played a role and that the fees generated for the work had not been distributed to Mr. Biden or others. A spokesman for President Biden on Friday said he had not been made aware of his son’s connection to the sale.How and why the firm had become involved was a mystery to the chief executive who negotiated the sale for Freeport-McMoRan’s Canadian-based partner, Lundin Mining.“Were they a partner, their adviser or a financier? I don’t know,” said Paul Conibear, then Lundin’s chief executive.An elaborate event under white tents in Kinshasa celebrated China’s new ownership in May 2017. Mr. Wang was there along with Chinese officials who had helped finance the purchase — and a host of Chinese government-affiliated bankers looking to make even more mining deals.Within a few years, they would help orchestrate China Molybdenum’s purchase of Kisanfu, the huge untapped cobalt reserve, from the same American mining giant. Together the sales marked a changing of the guard in Congo as the United States abandoned its mining interests — a problem that now weighs on President Biden as he and his aides have come to realize the extent of China’s dominance in clean energy.“The D.R.C. has a vast territory, rich natural resources and great investment potential,” Mr. Wang told the crowd. “A Chinese proverb says, ‘Build a beautiful nest to attract the phoenix.’”At first, the changes seemed almost trivial at Tenke Fungurume — a 24-hour operation that employs more than 7,000 across a landscape the size of Los Angeles marked by deep craters and dust kicked up by earth-moving vehicles.The new Chinese managers showed up in shorts and sneakers, a shock to employees who had been required to wear steel-toed boots and safety goggles.“We were like, ‘Oh, this is not possible,’” said Pierrot Kitobo Sambisaya, who worked as a metallurgist at the mine for a decade until 2019 and had grown accustomed to a stricter environment.Soon, work anniversaries came and went with no recognition. Holiday parties where workers’ families were invited to tour the mine no longer took place. Dozens of janitor and driver jobs once held by Congolese citizens went to the Chinese.That was just the start. Employees were concerned that the mine was also becoming more dangerous, according to interviews with workers in communities surrounding the mine, current and former safety inspectors, Congolese government officials and mining executives.Workers climbed into acid tanks to conduct repairs without checking the air quality. Others drove bulldozers and other heavy equipment without training or did dangerous welding jobs without proper oversight.Last year, a worker was sitting in his truck while it was being towed, and it flipped. The worker tried to jump to safety, but the truck landed on him and crushed him to death, according to an annual operations report from China Molybdenum.All of it was an extreme departure from the company’s American predecessor, which had “zero tolerance” for risky activities and safety violations, according to Alfred Kiloko Makeba, the veteran safety supervisor, and 10 other current and former employees, managers and contractors.Freeport-McMoRan, which had built the mine, had learned some hard lessons years before at its copper and gold mine in Indonesia, facing international protest over its dumping toxic mine waste into a river in the rainforest as well as violent conflicts over its operations there.In Congo, the company had its own struggles as it moved to build Tenke Fungurume, displacing more than 1,500 residents in a haphazard process. But once the mine opened, it gained an unusual amount of respect for its commitment to worker safety, both among local officials and U.S. diplomats.Worker safety is an issue at other industrial mines in Congo, but under Freeport, employees who violated rules were immediately disciplined or fired, safety officers said. Records examined by The Times show just one reported death among workers during the eight years Freeport-McMoRan ran the mine, although it repeatedly published accounts of near-fatal accidents as cautionary guides.When safety inspectors discovered violations after China Molybdenum took over, they were sometimes told to overlook them, or offered bribes to do so, workers and supervisors said. And when they did try to enforce the rules, violence sometimes followed.One safety officer said he was thrown to the ground by a worker he had called out for improperly using welding equipment. The man twisted his arm and broke his cellphone and work-issue camera.An executive at Gécamines, the Congolese agency that is a minority shareholder in the mine, said employees had reported confrontations and safety problems to the agency’s board. Safety issues are now part of a broader review of China Molybdenum’s operations.Mr. Zhou, the China Molybdenum spokesman, denied that any inspectors had been assaulted. The allegations, he suggested, were probably being fabricated by fired employees.In a statement to The Times, he said the mine had “a robust occupational health and safety framework in place and continues to exercise its zero tolerance rules.” In fact, he said, “internal statistics” published in a company report this year showed that worker injuries had declined since the company took over.But employees who said they had been repeatedly told not to report injuries believed the data was being fixed as part of a campaign to cover up rising hazards.That suggestion, which The Times was not able to independently confirm and which China Molybdenum disputed, was crystallized for Mr. Makeba one evening last year when he received an urgent phone call. A worker at the mine had fallen from a high perch after not wearing the required safety harness, he said.Mr. Makeba rushed to the site and was shocked to learn, he said, that the worker, who had broken his leg, had been taken to a private clinic instead of the mine’s.Mr. Makeba said the employee told him that his supervisors had paid him to keep quiet so that it would not be reported to management, where it would show up on the company’s audited injury tally.When Mr. Makeba alerted his own boss, he said, he was told to drop the matter.Mr. Zhou rejected Mr. Makeba’s account, adding that “any form of cover-up in disclosures is against rules, and corporate values.”But according to Mr. Makeba and another safety manager still working at the mine, labor conditions have become increasingly important to automakers sensitive to consumer and shareholder demands. So China Molybdenum, they said, has blocked them from reporting near fatalities and routinely ignored other injuries.“Safety is just on paper now,” Mr. Makeba said.Problems at Tenke Fungurume are not just limited to employees’ complaints inside the mine.Freeport-McMoRan had struggled with trespassers who carted off bags of cobalt. Some even died when hand-dug tunnels flooded or collapsed.With China Molybdenum in charge, the conflict became much worse.The company, faced with thousands of newly arriving trespassers, asked the government to send soldiers to help control the situation, one executive who worked at the mine back then told The Times.The military arrived and began patrolling Tenke Fungurume and other local mines, bulldozing depots where trespassers were selling their cobalt rocks to traders.The troops remained for months, and the situation eventually turned deadly. A soldier at Tenke Fungurume opened fire, killing an unauthorized digger, according to an employee who told The Times he had witnessed the encounter.Riots then erupted in the man’s home village when friends arrived carrying his body. In the melee, a protester was shot dead, according to three local officials and the mine employee.China Molybdenum paid for the burials, they said.Troops with AK-47s were posted outside the mine this year, along with security guards hired from a company founded by Erik Prince, the former Navy SEAL turned private security consultant.Even as this crackdown on theft was underway, the new managers at the mine were looking for ways to cut costs while increasing production.China Molybdenum said it had saved more than $130 million a year through its “cost and efficiency” programs. “New management revitalizes the business by bringing ‘Chinese efficiency and Chinese elements,’” the company boasts on its website.China Molybdenum is steadily growing its output. Last December, it snatched up Kisanfu, paying Freeport-McMoRan $550 million for what is considered one of the world’s largest untapped supplies of cobalt. The ground underneath the site contains enough cobalt, according to China Molybdenum’s estimates, to power hundreds of millions of long-range Teslas.And then in August, China Molybdenum announced plans to spend $2.5 billion at Tenke Fungurume to double production over the next two years. When the expansion is complete, the mine will produce nearly 40,000 tons a year. Last year, the United States produced just 600 tons.This rush to expand, however, has drawn scrutiny from top government officials in Congo, reaching all the way to Mr. Tshisekedi, the president.Questions have surfaced over payments Tenke Fungurume’s operators may owe to Congo, dating back to when the American company controlled the mine. When new deposits are confirmed at Tenke Fungurume, the owners are required to notify Gécamines, the Congolese agency, and pay $12 for every additional ton.The accusations have provoked a bitter dispute between Congolese officials and the mine managers, with China Molybdenum’s spokesman calling the allegations “unbelievable, wrong calculations” based on an accounting error.Gécamines executives have discussed forcing out the management at Tenke Fungurume or even taking the mine out of China Molybdenum’s control, according to two Congolese mining executives involved in confidential discussions as well as a government official briefed on the talks.Robert North, a New Mexico-based geologist who has helped prepare reserve estimates at the mine for Freeport and China Molybdenum, said both companies as well as Gécamines knew of large amounts of cobalt underground at the site. China Molybdenum has been cautious in declaring it, he said, until the company knows it wants to go to the expense of extracting the deeper layers.Mr. Tshisekedi’s commission is still investigating the allegations, and the president himself recently presided over a tense, six-hour meeting with top company executives.Separately, the Congolese government, with financial assistance from the United States, is examining numerous mining contracts to determine whether Congo has been shortchanged more broadly. While the Chinese-funded infrastructure projects got off to a flashy start, many have not been built, officials said.During a visit to the cobalt-mining region this year, the president acknowledged that corrupt or incompetent government officials in Congo might deserve some blame for deals that have left the nation feeling shortchanged.“Some of our compatriots had badly negotiated the mining contracts,” he said. “I’m very harsh on these investors who come to enrich themselves alone. They come with empty pockets and leave as billionaires.”Chinese government officials insist that the relationship is still on track and that the benefits to Congo are substantial.The countries have a “longstanding friendship, and the bilateral practical cooperation has yielded fruitful win-win results and enjoys broad prospects,” Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a news conference in September.In an interview in Kinshasa, Mr. Tshisekedi said that his focus was not on which foreign power would dominate mining in Congo, but rather on how his country could share in the wealth generated by the clean energy revolution.“We have an amazing potential for renewable energy, be it through our strategic metals or through our rivers,” he said, referring to both mining and hydroelectric power. “Our idea is, how can we put this amazing resource at the disposal of the world, but while making sure that it first benefits Congolese and it benefits Africans?”Dionne Searcey reported from Kisanfu, Michael Forsythe from New York and Eric Lipton from Washington. Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai.AdvertisementGuidance for the Brookings community and the public on our response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) »Learn more from Brookings scholars about the global response to coronavirus (COVID-19) »Nearly two years after the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) saw a peaceful transfer of power to President Félix Tshisekedi following a nevertheless flawed election, numerous significant political and economic developments have transpired in the country. The president’s chief of staff, Vital Kamerhe, was convicted on corruption charges; violent conflicts have increased in the eastern DRC; civil society has mounted increasing anti-corruption campaigns; and a major political reconfiguration is currently underway that may significantly change the shape of reforms. Meanwhile, in a bipartisan letter, the U.S. Senate highlighted the need for urgent anti-corruption and electoral reforms in the country and the International Monetary Fund is considering a significant loan to stabilize the country’s economy, pending anti-corruption reforms.On Friday, Dec. 18, the Foreign Policy program at Brookings hosted a panel discussion examining the issues and the possible U.S. policy options to address them.Viewers submitted questions via email to events@brookings.edu or on Twitter using #DRCSecurity.',\n",

as light danced through the forest canopy above, Fedrick Eshiloni reached into the ground and scooped up fists of ochre-colored earth.The scenery hardly resembled a hub of innovation: In this wooded stretch of Zambia’s northwest, home to reedy swamps and termite mounds the size of houses, locals still move goods by oxcart. But the 22-year-old, dressed in a blue workman’s uniform and accompanied by a team of prospectors, was performing a critical first step in an emerging high-tech quest to find the metals key to powering a clean energy future.After a day collecting bags of soil, Eshiloni and his colleagues would haul their samples to a makeshift camp, where they are dried, sieved, and tested for traces of 34 chemical elements. Even tiny amounts offer clues whether ores containing copper and cobalt, both critical to the production of electric vehicles, lie below.(The electric travel revolution has arrived. Read about it here.)These first steps aren’t so different from the way mining companies have explored since the mid 20th century. But what happens next amounts to a high-stakes test of new data-driven techniques that some believe could radically transform mining—and help limit global warming in the process.Unlike conventional prospectors, this team from KoBold Metals, a Bill Gates-backed California start-up, is using the data that they assemble—from soil samples to airborne surveys to reams of historical documents—as building blocks for a suite of complex geological models that are powered by artificial intelligence. KoBold and its backers are betting that AI will more effectively predict where ores have formed, and ultimately unlock new, deeper deposits.KoBold isn’t the only mining company that’s embracing big data to aid the next generation of discoveries. But its high-profile financiers and focus on the metals needed for the green energy revolution are drawing attention to an emerging raw materials bottleneck that risks thwarting global efforts, including deals negotiated at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Scotland, to build a less carbon-intensive world.According to the International Energy Agency, keeping global warming “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the central goal of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, will require unprecedented growth in the production of commodities like copper, cobalt, nickel, and lithium. All are essential building blocks for solar panels, wind turbines, power lines and, above all, battery-powered electric vehicles, which are less carbon intensive than their gas-fueled counterparts, especially where electricity is generated from renewables.By 2040, the IEA projects that meeting Paris targets will require annual global sales of more than 70 million electric cars and trucks, which together will demand as much as 30 times the quantity of metals that’s used in their production now.Shifting to a green future is not without contradictory complications—at least for the immediate future. Although new technologies and tighter regulations have made mining less environmentally destructive, the extraction and processing of metals still contaminates water and soil, encroaches on habitats, and emits pollutants and the same greenhouse gases that have caused a warming climate to begin with.Emissions linked to the minerals used in green energy technologies, however, are a small fraction of those generated by the fossil fuel-powered systems they’re designed to replace. Over time, as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates, more battery recycling could make the search for new battery metals less imperative. Some of the green transportation burden could be shouldered by other solutions still in development—such as cars fueled by hydrogen—or technologies not yet imagined.For now, though, analysts stress there’s no substitute for digging rocks out of the Earth.Keeping warming to below 2 degrees Celsius using existing technologies will require “massive additional volumes of metals,” says Julian Kettle, senior vice president of mining and metals at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy consultancy. “There’s simply no way around that.”Founded in 2018, KoBold derives its name from cobalt, a lustrous bluish-silver metal that helps drive performance of the lithium-ion batteries that revolutionized consumer electronics when they were introduced in the early 1990s. The same batteries are used on a much larger scale to power electric vehicles, and cobalt gives them greater range, longer lifespans, and better protection against fires by reducing corrosion.Its supply, though, is especially precarious: Nearly 70 percent is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a history of labor abuses and corruption have heightened the urgency to find deposits elsewhere. Automakers are also seeking cobalt alternatives—the metal, after all, is an expensive commodity—though the performance limitations of today’s cobalt-free batteries makes cobalt demand likely to accelerate. \\xa0Other metals KoBold seeks to unearth could soon feel a supply crunch as well. Gerbrand Ceder, a materials scientist who researches batteries at the University of California, Berkeley, believes nickel faces the greatest risk of long-term shortages, in part because it’s the most viable cobalt substitute.Analysts also foresee a scarcity of copper, which is used in a range of green technologies, including electric vehicle motors, wiring, and charging infrastructure. A typical battery powered automobile uses three times as much copper as its gas-guzzling cousins.These supply constraints have emerged, in part, because discovering viable metal deposits has become harder. That’s largely because the most accessible ones have been extracted: In Zambia, Africa’s second largest producer of copper, the ores mined today were either “sticking out of the ground” or just below the surface when they were found, according to David Broughton, a geologist with 25 years’ experience in the region who advises KoBold and others.This doesn’t mean there aren’t deposits lurking deeper in the earth: The interaction between rocks and fluids that formed them more than 400 million years ago occurred well beneath the surface. But unlike the oil and gas industry, which has gotten markedly better at accessing hard-to-reach places, mining exploration has not made a major technological leap in decades. As a result, odds of success are dismal. By most industry estimates, fewer than one percent of projects in areas without extensive prior exploration result in commercially viable deposits.KoBold’s goal is to “reduce the uncertainty of what’s under the surface,” says Josh Goldman, the company’s chief technology officer. A more rigorous application of data and a boost from the evolving field of artificial intelligence are key to improving those odds.Techniques of AI, including automation and machine learning, have already aided the climate fight by enabling better tracking of emissions, more sophisticated climate modeling, and the development of smart grids and other energy-saving devices. AI applications in mining have primarily focused on improving extraction from existing operations, though there’s gathering momentum in using them to aid the search for new deposits.Today, companies ranging from tech behemoths like IBM to more specialized outfits like Canada’s Minerva and GoldSpot offer AI tools or services geared toward exploration. KoBold, though, is one of the few that also invests its own capital in projects—including its efforts in Zambia and others in Canada, Greenland, and Western Australia.The company’s technological wizardry consists of two complementary systems. Connie Chan, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which invested in KoBold in 2019 along with Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, likens the first to a “Google Maps for the Earth’s crust and below.”Building it is a geological treasure hunt. Not only does KoBold collect its own data—drawn from rock and soil sampling, and measurements like gravity and magnetism taken from a helicopter. It also scours the historical record, using tools of machine learning—where computers draw insights from data too complex for humans—to extract key information from old maps and geological reports, which can run into the millions of pages. On some projects, KoBold forms joint ventures with established mining companies, which provide data of their own. BHP, the world’s most valuable mining firm, is a partner in Australia.KoBold uses all this information to build and train a suite of analytical tools it calls “machine prospector.” While they won’t unearth metals directly, they can give geologists a better idea of where to look—or where not to. One tool key to KoBold’s work in Zambia helps identify mafic rock—which can fool explorers into thinking they’ve found copper—and therefore prevent costly failed drilling.Another tool, in use in northern Quebec, where KoBold hopes to find nickel, copper, and cobalt, guides its research team to the most promising rock outcroppings for sampling, hastening the search. “You can actually get through an area of a couple hundred square kilometers in a season,” says David Freedman, a KoBold geologist who spent last summer traversing the tundra.Machine learning tools developed by KoBold and others have already made geologists’ lives easier; as Freedman notes, there’s no wind, rain, or mosquitos when planning out a prospecting route from behind a computer. Nonetheless, these techniques are still in their early stages and their ability to drive major finds remains an open question.Antoine Caté, a geologist and data scientist at SRK, an international consultancy, believes machine learning models have the potential to “dramatically improve” success rates in \\xa0exploration—in part due to their ability to detect patterns among datasets with more variables than the human brain can process. Still, he cautions such tools are only as good as the information that’s fed into them: If an algorithm is built with substandard data, it will be ineffective at best and at worst lead prospectors down false paths.AI also doesn’t eliminate the need for human ingenuity. “These tools are amazing for diagnostics,” Caté says. “But at the end of the day you still need a skilled person to take the information and make something out of it.”KoBold’s Goldman agrees. The need for robust data, he says, is why KoBold’s sleuthing is so meticulous. Still, he admits the company’s tech could take time to fulfill its promise, and how much it might speed up discoveries of deposits is uncertain.Chan, whose firm has helped fund tech giants like Airbnb and Instagram, believes the wait will be worth it. The mining industry’s exploration struggles and the urgency to find more battery metals, she says, means a software-driven approach is long overdue. “If anyone can show they’re more effective at choosing the right places to look—that’s incredibly valuable.”Even if machine learning techniques prove successful, though, it might not be enough to prevent future shortages. Better exploration is only part of the picture: To meet the Paris Agreement’s two-degree goal, Wood Mackenzie estimates that the mining industry will need to invest more than $2 trillion in mine development over the next 15 years—a colossal increase from the roughly $500 billion it committed in the 15 years prior. Scaling up will also require action from governments. Too often, Kettle says, policymakers stimulate demand for green technologies while also enacting regulations that make it harder to mine the materials needed to power them.In Zambia, embracing the green energy revolution is a national matter. A new government elected in August is seeking to turn around an economy ravaged by debt, and minerals, which account for three-quarters of exports, are essential to that puzzle. Minister of Mines Paul Chanda Kabuswe says the “looming boom” in battery metals has the potential to bring Zambia “immense benefits.” Still, no major deposits have been discovered in decades. To secure supply for the long run, the mining industry will need to do better.Humphrey Mbasela, a Zambian geologist helping KoBold make sense of the soil in Mushindamo District, believes the big data approach will help. For too long, he says, explorers have been “chicken scratching”—too focused on searching near the surface, while the big prizes lie deeper.“The resources are there, undercover,” he says after a day trudging through woods and fields gathering samples. “They’ve just not been unraveled.”Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2021 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

The task force seized 2,067 pounds of ivory and 75 pounds of pangolin scales worth approximately $3.5 million. Congolese law enforcement and Embassy officials then worked together to secure appropriate storage at the Central Bank for the seized items.\\xa0This operation was conducted in the context of the U.S.-DRC Privileged Partnership for Peace, Prosperity and Preservation of the environment, through which both countries work together to promote effective governance, improve the rule of law, fight corruption and combat crime. As it pertains to this case, the United States Government, particularly working through the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, is assisting the DRC protect its natural resources for the benefit of the Congolese people and humanity.\\xa0“I applaud the determined action of our U.S.-DRC task force. This successful operation exemplifies the United States government’s concrete commitment to collaborate with Congolese law enforcement to combat illicit wildlife trafficking that robs the DRC of its natural treasures and also serves to finance armed groups and terrorists,” said Ambassador Mike Hammer. “We will continue to work together to thwart these nefarious actors and protect the Democratic Republic of Congo’s biodiversity.”\\xa0The United States supports President Felix Tshisekedi and the Congolese government’s stated priority to end corruption and impunity. \\xa0To advance this common cause and continue to reduce the trafficking of wildlife products in the DRC and support global conservation efforts, the United States will continue to partner to increase the capacity of the DRC’s criminal justice system to investigate, arrest, and convict traffickers.

Corruption is at the core of a particular type of systemic corruption in Congo – a form of state capture – that incentivizes certain elites inside and outside the country to derive personal profit via illicit financial activity while undermining government institutions and the rule of law in the deeply impoverished country. Human rights abuses are also endemic to this system.Concerns extend far beyond vote rigging and lack of transparency during the vote tabulation process, with leaked results from Congo’s electoral commission and results compiled by the Catholic Church election observation mission showing that opposition coalition candidate Martin Fayulu had won by a landslide and not the candidate ultimately declared victorious, Félix Tshisekedi. Ultimately, this election rigging occurred in order to perpetuate a status quo of systemic corruption and violence. Achieving progress in other key areas hinges on meaningfully addressing grand corruption in Congo, or reform measures will be blocked by elites with a vested interest in perpetuating systemic state capture. Unless there is a major impact on grand corruption, endemic armed conflict – perpetuated in large part by corrupt elements in the Congolese army – will continue largely unabated alongside other human rights abuses and poverty. Moreover, efforts to improve Congo’s investment climate as well as implement much-needed judicial, security sector, and other governance reforms will falter.Despite the way in which the new government came to power, bolstered by a new parliamentary majority held by ex-president Joseph Kabila’s political coalition, Congo’s current political transition offers some new opportunities to begin to enact critical transparency and accountability reforms. The fact that the election was both largely peaceful and transferred power to an opposition candidate, albeit one far more closely aligned with Kabila than Fayulu, indicates that there is some window for reform.This moment of opportunity requires a two-track approach: engaging with the new administration in support of anti-corruption, transparency and accountability reforms on the one hand; and more aggressive financial pressure targeted toward the heart of the system of violent kleptocracy. The latter will provide the new government the political space it needs to enact key reforms.The United States, European Union, and African Union can play key roles in combating corruption by leveraging Congolese reform efforts to transform Congo’s deeply embedded kleptocratic system. While closely engaging with Congolese civil society and the government on good governance, transparency, security and anti-corruption reforms, these actors should make strategic use of financial pressure against high-profile corrupt actors. Recent US sanctions against three senior electoral commission officials are an important step to hold accountable those responsible for election fraud. However, much more significant financial pressure is needed on political leaders and their commercial partners inside and outside Congo in order to have a real impact leading to desperately needed transparency and good governance reforms. These actors have profited personally from a corrupt system that enables violence while the majority of the country has suffered from poor health services, education and infrastructure, as well as security services that are frequently predatory on the civilian population. The use of financial pressure tools will be key to undermining the influence of former president Joseph Kabila and his inner circle, who were involved in extensive corruption during their time in office and yet continue to wield significant – perhaps even preponderant – influence in the new government, including in the military, the parliament, the judiciary, and the executive.Anti-corruption reforms in Congo will only succeed if they are strongly supported by Congolese civil society and backed by international financial pressure, particularly through targeted network sanctions and anti-money laundering measures. The United States has a unique ability to exert financial pressure on corrupt actors because of Congo’s reliance on US dollar transactions, which are overwhelmingly cleared by US banks and other financial institutions. The European Union, individual European governments and the African Union also have critical roles to play, as corrupt officials frequently travel to and own properties and bank accounts in Europe and elsewhere in Africa.Through this two-pronged approach, the United States, European Union and African Union can help create political space to allow President Tshisekedi to follow through on reforms to transform Congo’s corrupt system into a more democratic, transparent state. Targeted network sanctions and anti-money laundering measures against officials, their companies and networks of associates involved in corruption would marginalize them from positions of power and therefore lessen their influence in the new government. For example, it will be difficult for Tshisekedi to name officials under sanctions as ministers for fear of sparking further sanctions and anti-money laundering measures. Similarly, financial measures targeting corrupt business deals over state contracts could also pressure the Tshisekedi government to investigate and potentially re-negotiate these deals.',\n",

The August election of Zambia\\'s President Hakainde Hichilema, which he won by a landslide, was widely hailed as a milestone for African opposition movements.But while in his first 100 days in office Hichilema had reassured investors, he has been seen to drag his feet on promises to fight corruption and reduce poverty, fuelling impatience among voters.Zambians turned out en masse to vote for change on August 12, fed up with growing economic hardship and repression under their former leader Edgar Lungu.Hichilema inherited a heavily indebted country -- the first in Africa to default during Covid -- and soured bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Sworn in on August 24, he vowed to revive the economy, root out graft and woo back scarred investors to Africa\\'s second copper producer.Much of the international community remains starry-eyed, but some Zambians are beginning to feel disenchanted.\"The president is too slow,\" said Martin Nawa, a 30-year-old newspaper vendor in the capital Lusaka.\"These people are hiding whatever they have stolen,\" he told AFP, referring to alleged embezzlement by the previous regime.Critics say Hichilema has been slow to take action against wrongdoers.So far, only one former state journalist has been charged for acquiring property with public funds. She was freed after surrendering her assets.\"He has only shown the will to fight corruption, but he will not achieve anything with the same officials in the police\" and anti-graft bodies, said Zambian rights activist Brebner Changala.A self-made businessman, Hichilema centred his campaign on economic restructuring.The 2022 budget he presented to parliament at the end of October was well-received among investors and creditors -- reassured by promised fiscal reforms, spending cuts and debt transparency.These measures \"will help the country make progress in debt restructuring\" and facilitate negotiations with the IMF that resumed this month, said Aleix Montana of risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft.Hichilema has been critical in international media of the billions of dollars of sovereign debt Lungu accumulated during his six-year rule.He claims it was grossly underestimated, particularly regarding money owed to China.The president \"is quite popular among investors, especially in the mining sector,\" said Montana, pointing to a new policy that will allow companies to deduct mineral royalties from corporate tax.Zambia\\'s sovereign bond prices, which jumped after Hichilema\\'s election, have continued to increase steadily, he added.Hichilema has sought to shelter citizens from the impact of fiscal reforms, increasing constituency development funds and introducing free access to secondary school.He also removed bribe-taking political cadres who controlled markets and bus stations under Lungu.But a \"proposed reduction of subsidies for fertiliser, electricity and fuel is likely to have a serious knock-on effect on people\\'s budgets,\" noted South Africa-based political analyst Nicole Beardsworth.Inflation has remained stuck at a high of over 20 percent, she added, stressing that it was still too early to draw a line.For his part, the more optimistic Zambian economist Maambo Hamaundu said: \"I can confidently say that as a country we are on the right trajectory/\"Politically, Hichilema set off on a positive note, freezing the bank accounts of Lungu\\'s close aides and filling government positions with technocrats.And even critics agree the new government is less repressive.\"What 100 days has done to us is give us back our freedom and liberty, and for that we must give him credit,\" Changala said.\\xa0Beardsworth, however, flagged a \"mushrooming of appointments to State House\" which he derided as \"thank-you appointments\".Eyebrows have also been raised around a flurry of work trips Hichilema has already made.Since a first trumpeted visit to the United States for the UN General Assembly, he has travelled to Glasgow for COP26 and attended events in Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa.Lusaka resident Sean Tembo, who leads a small opposition party, described the new president as Zambia\\'s \"Vasco da Gama\", a reference to the 16th-century Portuguese explorer.\"I travelled with a lean delegation\" on a commercial flight, Hichilema has tweeted in his defence, distancing himself from Lungu\\'s controversial presidential jet.A government spokesman declined to comment on Hichilema\\'s first 100 days in office, saying an official statement would be issued on the topic.The high expectations spurred by Hichilema\\'s victory could be a \"double-edged sword\", Montana said.\"Discontent will grow if he is unable to provide some tangible results,\" he warned. \"The people who voted for him are expecting a real change soon.\"',\n",

'The President of Zanzibar, Dr Hussein Ali Mwinyi, has outlined plans to construct the Manga Pwani Port that is expected to be the continent’s...Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo — \\'We have all old machines, all old equipment.\\'Funding challenges and security threats are hampering the monitoring of one of the world\\'s most volatile volcanoes - the Democratic Republic of Congo\\'s Mount Nyiragongo - even after a May eruption cost dozens of lives and left tens of thousands of people living in displacement camps.Money is so short at the Goma Volcano Observatory (GVO) that staff members complained of sometimes lacking fuel for field trips, having computers that can\\'t process hefty data sets, and wearing faulty masks that don\\'t protect them from gases spewed out by Mount Nyiragongo.Funding cuts at the Goma Volcano Observatory hampered monitoring efforts ahead of a May eruption that left tens of thousands of people homeless.The Congolese government has provided additional support to the observatory since the eruption but funding problems persist.Congolese volcanologists face security threats and health risks while doing poorly-compensated work.Mount Nyiragongo remains a major risk to residents of Goma, an eastern city of 1.5 million people.GVO researchers say they work in risky conditions with limited security support. The monitoring sites where they travel to collect data are located in remote places in Virunga National Park, a wildlife sanctuary that is also home to a patchwork of armed groups. Staff members have been shot and wounded while on duty.\"We could predict [eruptions] if we had funding and if we had security in Virunga,\" Honoré Ciraba, a senior scientist at the GVO, told The New Humanitarian earlier this month.GVO researchers say their problems need addressing before disaster strikes again: Mount Nyiragongo is considered dangerous because of its fast-flowing lava and its proximity to Goma, an eastern Congolese city of 1.5 million people. Previous eruptions in 1977 and 2002 claimed hundreds of lives on each occasion.The volcano also sits adjacent to Lake Kivu, a body of water between Congo and Rwanda that contains vast amounts of toxic gas. Scientists say the gas could suffocate lakeside residents - an event known as a limnic eruption - if disturbed by an earthquake or a volcanic event\"The population is still vulnerable to the volcanic risks posed by Mount Nyiragongo,\" said Abel Minani, a researcher at the GVO, which is a state institution that falls under Congo\\'s Ministry of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation.Founded in 1986, the GVO was in a bad state before the May eruption. The World Bank decided not to renew a $1.8 million programme amid corruption allegations at the observatory, leaving it unable to pay internet bills, even as its staff warned of increased volcanic activity.After the eruption - which temporarily displaced 450,000 people - Congo\\'s government began topping up the wages of GVO staff, according to Adalbert Muhindo, the observatory\\'s director. He hopes a new seismology laboratory will soon be built, and that an upcoming international volcanology conference will bring new partnerships and support to the observatory.But interviews with GVO researchers in the aftermath of the eruption indicate that funding problems persist. And few staff members expect the recent salary supplements to last given the government\\'s long-standing failure to properly fund the observatory. Officials at Congo\\'s scientific ministry did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.Residents displaced by the volcano are, meanwhile, struggling to rebuild their lives. Though some have received support since the eruption, relief groups generally consider the crisis a low priority compared to other issues affecting eastern Congo, where more than a million people have been displaced in 2021.Jean de Dieu Mbasa lost his home in May, and with it the money to send his son to school. For a few dollars, he shifts heavy stones on the now-cooled lava to mark where people\\'s houses once stood. He uses torn socks over his hands to protect them from the heat.\"We lost many things because there was no warning [that the volcano would erupt],\" he told The New Humanitarian.Risky work, poorly rewardedBased in an office overlooking a dusty football pitch in Goma, the GVO is responsible for researching Mount Nyiragongo as well as its sister volcano, Mount Nyamuragira, which has been especially active in recent days.It is a Herculean job: Equipment regularly gets looted, destroyed in lightning strikes, or tangled in tropical vegetation, while patchy internet and bumpy dirt roads create other headaches.Despite a lack of resources, the observatory predicted the 2002 Mount Nyiragongo eruption, which flattened around 15 percent of Goma and triggered a major humanitarian crisis - in part because local authorities didn\\'t heed the GVO\\'s warnings.International aid was provided for reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the 2002 disaster. And greater support was extended to the GVO in the form of new equipment and staff training, various UN programmes, and long-standing international scientific research partnerships.Still, international funding dwindled as the memory of what happened in 2002 receded among foreign donors. And recent corruption allegations at the observatory put off donors, according to UN officials in Congo and members of the GVO.Awareness of the danger posed by Mount Nyiragongo also waned over the years among Goma\\'s population. Some residents settled in villages just a few kilometres from the volcano, in areas identified as high-risk.Warning panels installed in Goma to alert residents to the fluctuating danger posed by the volcano were ignored, or in some cases used for local advertising, according to recent research.Since the May eruption, additional equipment has been sent to the observatory and monitoring measures have been stepped up, according to Muhindo, who travelled to Kinshasa, Congo\\'s capital, in recent months to lobby the government for more support.But the current funding from the government doesn\\'t cover the GVO\\'s full research needs, Célestin Kasereka Mahinda, the observatory\\'s scientific director, told The New Humanitarian during an interview in August at his office in Goma.Mahinda said machines and equipment need replacing, GVO staff members need training - some of them abroad - and more awareness-raising needs to be done for Goma\\'s population.In October, one researcher said the institute didn\\'t have enough funds to afford a drone to take high-resolution photos of the May eruption site, while in July staff said the observatory was struggling to raise money for a research trip to the volcano summit.Several GVO researchers who spoke to The New Humanitarian said they were earning as little as 40 dollars per month and have often paid out of their own pockets to travel large distances to collect data. Some have taken side jobs to make ends meet.The volcanologists have also faced health risks as a consequence of their work. Charles Balagizi, a GVO scientist, said he had not been able to replace the filters in his gas mask - given to him by the US Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) in 2019 - for the past two years. His lungs have suffered as a result, doctors told him recently.The researchers said their salaries don\\'t reflect the importance of their mission, nor the challenges they face when travelling to remote places - challenges The New Humanitarian saw first hand on field trips with the GVO in July and August.On one mission in July, researchers balanced on hardened lava rocks examining the width of new fissures that had cracked open in the earth in May. The trip took the team though Virunga National Park, on a road known for its ambush risk.The next month scientists drove down dirt roads outside of Goma to collect crucial seismic data, passing areas where carbon dioxide emitted by the volcano can suffocate children and animals. A dead bird lying on the ground was said to be the latest victim.The monitoring efforts require constant commitment, said Dario Tedesco, an Italian volcanologist who has dedicated his life to studying Mount Nyiragongo. \"You need to do it every day, every single hour of the day,\" he told The New Humanitarian.Funding cuts and corruption concernsVolcanologists argue that there was no clear precursor event that could have predicted the May eruption, even though signs of increased volcanic activity were present in the months before.Still, the World Bank\\'s decision not to renew a programme that ended in October 2020 left the GVO lacking money to do crucial field missions, said Ciraba, the senior scientist. After the internet was cut, the institute also lost access to real time data, he added.The internet was eventually restored in April thanks to a contribution from VDAP. But a seven-month gap left volcanologists missing crucial details about volcanic activity at Mount Nyiragongo.The World Bank decision came amid allegations of embezzlement at the GVO, though the Bank said it could not corroborate those claims. Instead, it said the decision was based on the institution\\'s \"weakness\" in implementing grants.In an emailed statement to The New Humanitarian, a World Bank spokesperson said that - on completion of the grant - the organisation had emphasised to the Congolese government the importance of giving the GVO resources to cover its operational costs.But the government appears not to have plugged the gap, while other donors failed to step forward, said Omar Aboud, who previously led the Goma operation of the UN\\'s peacekeeping mission in Congo, known by its French acronym MONUSCO.Despite joint advocacy efforts by MONUSCO and the GVO, Aboud said donors lacked funding \"for this kind of unexpected and unplanned support\" and were put off by the corruption allegations.Aboud and other MONUSCO officials said the mission provided support to the GVO both before and after the May eruption. This includes helicopter flights to Mount Nyiragongo and the facilitation of outreach efforts to donors and diplomats.But Aboud said further support to the GVO \"would be too technical and scientific for a peacekeeping mission... would require a very high budget that MONUSCO does not have, and would fall way beyond our mandate\".The GVO also receives support from a group of international scientific partner organisations. But funding for these projects is usually focused on scientific objectives rather than the long-term operating costs of the observatory.Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inboxBy submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.Almost finished...We need to confirm your email address.To complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just sent you.There was a problem processing your submission. Please try again later.Mahinda, the scientific director, said volcanic eruptions are natural phenomena that can\\'t be stopped, but added: \"if we had proper materials and good financial treatment here... maybe we could have reduced the costs we saw during the eruption.\"The costs were particularly high for Nyabatezi Subirayo, a Goma resident who was separated from one of her children while managing to escape the eruption. \"If there had been a warning, I would not have lost my child,\" she said in July from a displacement camp.\\'Evil winds\\' and a limnic eruptionThe threat posed by Mount Nyiragongo has increased since the eruption. Fresh fractures have opened in the ground that \"could be gates for new lava flows reaching Goma\", said the GVO\\'s Balagizi.Balagizi said the danger of a limnic eruption will persist as long as there is an active rift that can generate earthquakes capable of destabilising Lake Kivu, and as long as there are active volcanoes that can produce eruptive vents within the lake or empty hot lava into its depths.The pockets of carbon dioxide emitted by the volcano - referred to as Mazuku, or evil wind - pose another hazard to human health, as do plumes of sulphur dioxide, which can cause acid rain and contaminate drinking water.While various initiatives seek to raise awareness of the risks associated with Mount Nyiragongo - teachers in Goma use board games to help students know what to do in an emergency, for example - GVO scientists say more needs to be done.\"People have to watch and listen to understand what the scientists are teaching,\" said Muhindo, the GVO director. \"They must also avoid building infrastructure in places where there are lava flows.\"Aboud, the former MONUSCO official, said risks will remain no matter how much funding is forthcoming. \"If volcanoes are unpredictable, and the lava could take... half an hour to reach the city, how much can money really help?\" he said, adding: \"The population [is] squeezed between the volcano and the lake, and there are very few escape routes.\"Muhindo, however, is optimistic that the threats posed by Mount Nyiragongo can be properly managed by the observatory - should it be appropriately funded. \"Everybody is paying attention to GVO [after the eruption],\" he said. \"Very soon, things will change.\"With local reporting and research from an individual whose name is being withheld due to security concerns.Read the original article on The New Humanitarian.AllAfrica publishes around 700 reports a day from more than 100 news organizations and over 500 other institutions and individuals, representing a diversity of positions on every topic.

I do not know if he is already in prison,\" a member of the government told AFP, requesting anonymity \"in the name of the separation of powers.\"Dr. Eteni has indeed arrived here at the Makala central prison on the basis of a provisional arrest warrant issued by the prosecutor\\'s office. We have installed him in pavilion 8,\" a prison official told AFP on condition of anonymity.The transfer to the prison took place in the early evening, according to several sources contacted by AFP. Mr. Eteni Longondo, Minister of Health from 2019 until last April, is accused of \"misappropriation of public funds allocated to the response\" against Covid-19, wrote on Twitter the Association for Access to Justice (ACAJ).In August 2020, the General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF) had suspected the former minister Longondo of having embezzled more than 7 million dollars intended for the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic in the DRC, whose management is characterized by \"the absence of supporting documents of expenses\" made.Mr. Longondo has always denied having embezzled this money, arguing that \"these documents were in the process of being verified by his services\" at the time of the audit. In November, he returned $721,900 to the public treasury, representing \"the overpayment\" and \"the difference on the decontamination of the People\\'s Palace\", the seat of parliament, as well as a \"double payment made by the Central Bank of Congo\".Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has made the fight against corruption one of the priorities of his term. Mr. Longondo is the first executive of the presidential party Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) to be arrested for embezzling public funds.The former chief of staff to the Congolese leader, Vital Kamerhe, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for embezzling more than $50 million to build prefabricated houses for the military and police.AFPThe U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is investigating alleged corruption in mining deals in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where foreign companies purportedly bribed officials up to US$360 million between 2006 and 2011.More than 70% of the world’s cobalt comes from the resource-rich central African country, but more than 73% of its people live below the international poverty line. (Photo: Fairphone, Flickr, License)U.K. investigators first referred the case to Swiss authorities in 2014, and again in 2019 on the back of related claims of money laundering. The March 30 Swiss Federal Criminal Court decision dismissing the appeal made by one of the companies in question, which reveals details about the case for the first time, was only recently made public.The judgment identifies an anonymous individual “C” as a primary target of the corruption investigation. Although the court has not confirmed the identity of “C”, news sources have linked “C” to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a powerful mining magnate who has been placed under sanctions by the U.S. State Department for “extensive public corruption.”\"Insofar as is known, this is apparently the largest sum of money any Israeli has ever been suspected of paying as graft,\" Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.Gertler has been described by the U.S. Treasury Department as having amassed his fortune through “hundreds of millions of dollars worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals.”Gertler’s friendship with former Congolese president Joseph Kabila allowed him to act as a middleman for mining sales, costing the DRC over $1.36 billion between 2010 and 2012 alone in revenues from underpriced mining assets sold to Gertler’s offshore companies.U.K. prosecutors have records showing that a DRC financial entity gave cash collected from local Congolese companies to “C,” who then paid an influential member of parliament described as the “right hand” man of the president. Payments were also made to people in senior positions in the DRC government. “C” later repaid those companies using Swiss bank accounts and the client account of a law firm.The court judgment suggested that “C” could only secure the goodwill and influence of the close presidential advisor by responding to “substantial, sometimes demanding, urgent and unforeseeable demands” from him via cash payments.More than 70% of the world’s cobalt comes from the resource-rich central African country, but more than 73% of its people live below the international poverty line. In 170th place among 180 countries, the DRC also sits at the very bottom of Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, an indicator of public sector corruption.And get our latest investigations on organized crime and corruption delivered straight to your inbox.We use cookies to improve your experience by storing data about your preferences, your device or your browsing session.

Yet, he stuck to his plans and took a train to return to Paris, where he lives in exile. Halfway through the journey, as he prepared to switch trains in Lille, he realized that his bag with both his laptops was gone.Lumumba had gone to Brussels as spokesperson for a group of Congolese activists called “Dynamic Congo 2060.” During a press conference on July 24, he spoke about fighting corruption and impunity in Congo, upcoming election issues, and insecurity in the country’s east.Minutes after his presentation, he received a phone call from a trusted Congolese security source warning him that he might be under surveillance during his trip.On July 28, three days after Lumumba’s bag had disappeared, police summoned his tenants in Kinshasa, Congo’s capital, for interrogation. The police alleged that the house they rented, and which Lumumba owns, had been purchased with illegal funds and threatened them with eviction unless they provided documents containing personal information about their landlord.Two days later, Lumumba’s car was found burned-out in its parking place near his home on the outskirts of Paris. He filed a police report. \\xa0Lumumba was forced into exile in 2016 after he witnessed wrongdoings while working as an executive at the Congolese subsidiary of BGFI bank and revealed a massive corruption scandal involving the family of then-President Joseph Kabila and close associates. The trove of documents he disclosed, known as the Lumumba Papers, exposed a system of entrenched corruption, misuse of public funds, illegal financing, and embezzlement.“My wife and kids are shocked and scared,” Lumumba told Human Rights Watch by phone. Nevertheless, he remains committed to exposing and hoping to help rid Congo of corruption.\\xa0This new spate of intimidation and threats against Lumumba both in Europe and Kinshasa is of grave concern not just for Lumumba and those close to him, but to all those fighting corruption in Congo. Officials seeking to promote the rule of law in Congo should not only be investigating all allegations of corruption but also those seeking to deter whistleblowers from speaking out.\\xa0Access to Services for Survivors of Gender-Based Violence in Ethiopia’s Tigray RegionViolence Against Women and Girls During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Kenya',\n",

Join our movement today.Human Rights Watch  is a 501(C)(3)\\xa0nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808Picture a sinking ship in which a large group of people are fighting for a few, increasingly torn life jackets. Something similar is happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at every point in a chain of bribe-taking that stretches from the lowest public officials to the top of the government. The DRC’s people are being harmed by a semi-official culture, known as “débrouillez-vous” (fend for yourself).What the Congolese think about corruption & briberyIn our survey of 47,000 citizens in 35 African countries, the Global Corruption Barometer, we asked DRC citizens about their views on and experiences of corruption. Eighty-five per cent said that corruption is increasing, 80 per cent said that the government is doing a bad job at tackling it, and 80 per cent said they need to pay bribes for public services, like the police, water supply and identification documents.It comes as little surprise that the Congolese see institutions like the police, the judiciary and the government as full of corruption, nor sadly, that less than a third think that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption.These findings are far worse than in most other African countries: slightly over half of all Africans think that corruption is getting worse, while 28 per cent of Africans have to pay bribes for public services.Why is corruption so prevalent in the DRC, why is bribery so commonplace and why do two thirds of citizens feel powerless?The state of corruption in the DRCA range of factors contribute to the DRC’s high corruption levels. Weak democracy allows corrupt politicians to maintain power, while ineffective institutions give opportunities for corruption rather than preventing it. People who expose or oppose corrupt systems are suppressed. The country also has low levels of stateness, a key tool that undemocratic regimes can use against corruption: the government doesn’t control its own army, competes for local power with many militias and has little control of movement through its eastern borders.The DRC’s leaders tend to drive corruption rather than try to clean it up. This is done through patronage networks where those with power give others jobs and contracts in exchange for bribes. This makes the powerful very rich — former President Joseph Kabila owns more than 80 companies and 71,000 hectares of farmland — and means that poorly paid low level officials have to demand bribes to survive.This act of preying on the people with less power is made more aggressive by job insecurity; leaders tend to strategically and regularly fire public officials to stop them from getting too much power. This encourages many officials to grab as much money as they can — through bribes and also embezzlement — as quickly as possible.They are able to do so undetected and with impunity because the DRC’s institutions are frequently not transparent — the state-owned oil company Cohyrdo is one of the world’s least transparent state-owned companies — and have low capacity to effectively monitor and manage their activities. This has led to hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure loans from the Chinese government going missing, for example.The chances of officials being sanctioned for corruption are further reduced by the DRC’s anti-corruption framework being very poorly implemented. Laws criminalising public sector corruption and requiring officials to report any bribery are rarely acted on, and any well-connected official who is prosecuted for corruption can expect an acquittal, as the judiciary is controlled by politicians and bribes.Citizens footing the billWhether it’s through slowed development or bribe-taking, it is ordinary citizens who suffer.The DRC’s 10 million market sellers are one of many demographics who get asked for bribes on a regular basis. A market seller’s drive to pick up goods might involve a traffic police officer demanding a bribe, an army run roadblock taking some of those goods and then a local government official requiring an unofficial tax to let the market seller trade.Local and provincial governments are known to demand hundreds of types of taxes, frequently for services that aren’t delivered. Many officials also pocket — and then bribe superiors with — large proportions of the taxes that they collect. Additionally, their need to deliver sufficient tax revenues to government accounts, whilst taking tax money for themselves, means that officials tax impoverished Congolese citizens at very high rates, taking 40 to 50 per cent of their income.There are, unfortunately, several reasons why two thirds of citizens don’t feel like they can make a difference against corruption: their votes are apparently not being counted in elections; the reported landslide winner of the 2018 general elections, Martin Fayulu, did not become president. Instead Felix Tshisekedi became president after an election involving many irregularities. Citizens are discouraged by protesters and opposition politicians being violently suppressed, and worry that the culture of fending for yourself is too deeply ingrained in their society.What’s next for the DRC?The Congolese can change their country and Felix Tshisekedi’s government has a chance to bring integrity to the DRC. It should start by strengthening democracy with a free press and judiciary, and full political rights. Tshisekedi must also adequately fund independent anti-corruption agencies, and fully implement the DRC’s anti-corruption framework. This will help strengthen its institutions while ensuring that state funds aren’t embezzled, procurement is ethical and corrupt acts are punished.A collection of articles, stories, analyses and opinions…5 5\\xa0claps5 Written byTransparency International is the global coalition fighting against corruption.

Congo's former prime minister, Matata Ponyo Mapon (right), is seen with Belgium's former PM, Elio Di Rupo, before a meeting in Brussels, June 24, 2014.  REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File PhotoKINSHASA, July 5 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo's former prime minister Matata Ponyo Mapon's parliamentary immunity was lifted on Monday, as the Senate leadership announced it had authorised a criminal investigation into allegations he misappropriated $140 million.Congo's public prosecutor last month accused Matata of ordering payments to people without valid claims to government compensation under a law meant to reimburse foreign businesspeople who had their properties seized in the 1970s.  read more The prosecutor, Jean-Paul Mukolo, said Matata personally benefited from the payments while serving as finance minister in 2011, but Mukolo did not provide evidence of this.Matata, who served as prime minister from 2012-2016, has not responded to requests for comment about the accusations.Senate president Modeste Bahati informed the prosecutor of the Senate leadership's decision in a letter seen by Reuters. The investigation could lead to eventual criminal charges.Last month, the Senate rejected a request by prosecutors to lift Matata's immunity over allegations he misappropriated funds from a failed agriculture project.  read more Matata denied those allegations and said they are part of a smear campaign against him.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

All rights reservedThe UAE’s record on illicit finance raises concerns for its relationship with the world’s poorest continent, experts say.\\xa0In 2018, the son of the president of the island nation of Comoros was back home in the capital city of Moroni and looking to make a buck.Nour El Fath Azali, a former bank auditor and American business school graduate, set up a shell company in the United Arab Emirates, according to records from the Pandora Papers investigation. The company, Olifants Ltd., offered consultancy and other advisory services.Months later, Comorian President Azali Assoumani appointed his son as a personal adviser. The younger Azali now works to persuade Emirati officials to invest in the Comoros, a small cluster of islands off the east coast of Africa with a government that international observers say is plagued by systemic corruption.Owning shell companies and bank accounts in the UAE, one of the world’s most secretive financial havens, is a growing trend among African politicians and their business allies.“The UAE is the center of the world,”\\xa0 Nour El Fath Azali, 37, recently told ICIJ media partner La Gazette des Comores.The Pandora Papers investigation discovered secretive Emirati financial interests of politicians and powerful business leaders from 17 African countries.The Pandora Papers, a global media collaboration that exposes the hidden financial deals of the world’s rich and powerful, is based on leaked records from 14 firms that help set up shell companies and bank accounts.\\xa0 Among these so-called offshore providers is SFM Corporate Services,\\xa0 based in the UAE’s financial capital, Dubai.“The UAE, de facto, tolerates illicit flows and trades that other more reputable international financial centers shun,” said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a University of Oxford professor who leads a research project on African countries and major financial centers, including Dubai. “In exchange for its acceptance that dubious players and monies be based in the country, the UAE merely asks wealthy Africans to stay out of local politics and stay within the boundaries of local law,” Soares de Oliveira said.Those drawn to the UAE praise its light-touch approach to business regulation and its convenient time zone, between those of Europe and Asia. UAE companies often provide generous tax exemptions to foreigners, and owners aren’t required to open an office or disclose their names on public registers.The UAE, de facto, tolerates illicit flows and trades that other more reputable international financial centers shun — Ricardo Soares de OliveiraFinancial crime experts and tax and law enforcement officials, however, point to the UAE’s history as a conduit for corrupt proceeds.The Persian Gulf nation has ignored money laundering for years, according to a 2020 report prepared by a team of international experts for the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, the main international organization for coordinating global anti-money laundering efforts. The report noted that the UAE is reluctant to share information about the owners of companies created there with authorities in other countries.Azali said, in response to questions from ICIJ, that he closed Olifants Ltd. in 2019 before it conducted any business and before he joined his father’s administration.Politicians worldwide, including many from Africa, have beaten a path to the UAE, according to the Pandora Papers and other media investigations.In 2018, a newly elected member of Kenya’s Parliament, Tindi Mwale, emailed SFM in Dubai, paying $2,641 to set up a company called Sahel & Scott Holdings Ltd and a bank account in the island nation of Mauritius.Mwale, who launched a real estate, engineering, consulting and construction conglomerate before entering politics in 2017, \\xa0told SFM that he planned to build roads, bridges, sewerage systems and oil pipelines. He signed emails with his government title, including a reference to the western Kenyan region he represents in Parliament: “Hon. Tindi Mwale, M.P. Butere Constituency.”Kenyan officials must declare to authorities their assets and wealth. In a brief telephone interview, Mwale denied owning an offshore company.“I’ve never chosen any company outside of Kenya,” Mwale told an ICIJ reporter in a telephone interview over WhatsApp before blocking the reporter’s phone number. “I’m even surprised that you are pushing things that are lies.”Be it a luxury villa,\\xa0 a shell company for holding hidden wealth, or the services of Dubai-based accountants or lawyers, the UAE has something for elites of all stripes, including Africa’s most influential politicians and business leaders.Isabel dos Santos, the oldest daughter of Angola’s former president, José Eduardo dos Santos, and her husband, the late Sindika Dokolo, lived in Dubai and owned or held shares in at least 10 UAE companies, according to ICIJ’s 2020 investigation, Luanda Leaks. The Pandora Papers revealed that Isabel dos Santos also worked with a corporate services company in the UAE to manage income received from Unitel, Angola’s largest mobile phone company.Dos Santos is wanted in Angola on charges that she caused the country to lose more than $1 billion from insider deals. Her husband died in 2020. Dos Santos denies wrongdoing and is reported to have remained in Dubai.Living near dos Santos in Dubai was Rukaiyatu Abubakar, a wife of Nigeria’s former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, who owned a four-bedroom apartment, according to a tenancy agreement in the Pandora Papers.Not far from Abubakar lived\\xa0 Farid Bedjaoui, the nephew of a former Algerian foreign minister.In 2013,Italian authorities charged Bedjaoui with bribery and corruption, alleging that he used his influence to inflate oil and gas contracts and then skimmed millions of dollars for himself. He was nicknamed “Mr. 3%” in some news reports, a reference to his alleged share of the illicit proceeds.\\xa0 Last year, Italy’s highest court acquitted him. Bedjaoui also owned a UAE company, according to the Pandora Papers.Prominent Africans aren’t the only rich and powerful people who have moved to the UAE.Nurali Aliyev, grandson of Kazakhstan’s president, lived on a famous palm tree-shaped artificial island in Dubai, according to the Pandora Papers. Another expatriate in Dubai was Delyan Peevski, a former Bulgarian member of Parliament whom the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned in 2021 for alleged corruption. Peevski used a UAE residency card to set up a shell company in the Seychelles. Under Bulgarian law, lawmakers cannot be official residents of other countries.Dos Santos, Bedjaoui, Aliyev, Peevski and their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. Paul Ibe, a spokesman for the Abubakar family, told ICIJ that Rukaiyatu Abubakar is a private citizen and that the couple purchased the Dubai property with funds from the former vice president’s “personal business investments.”Prominent nonresidents who did business in Dubai included Ali Khalif Galaydh, a former Somalian prime minister, according to the Pandora Papers. He was in Dubai in 2006 for a meeting of his company Somtel International Ltd., registered in the British Virgin Islands.Galaydh founded Somtel, a telecommunications company now with a major market share in Somalia, in the 1990s. The businessman and former government minister lived in Dubai before he became Somalia’s prime minister in October 2000. Somali lawmakers voted him out of office in October 2001, contending that he had failed to stanch lawlessness and violence in the war-torn country. He died in 2020.Minutes from a March 2006 meeting in Dubai show that Galaydh resigned as director of the BVI company that year and relinquished his shares. Also attending the meeting was fellow shareholder Abdourahman Boreh, a Djiboutian millionaire described in U.S. State Department cables as a “perennial confidante and business partner” of Djibouti’s dictatorial president, Ismaïl Omar Guelleh.In January 2013, records show, Djibouti’s communications minister, Abdi Houssein Ahmed, set up Issir Media Consulting Co. Ltd., an offshore company in the BVI. Ahmed managed his shell company through attorneys in Dubai and through the BVI and UAE offices of Trident Trust, one of the world’s largest offshore service providers. Ahmed created the shell company to own real estate, intellectual property and bank accounts, according to records.A former adviser to Djibouti’s foreign ministry, Ahmed, in 2011, was appointed minister of culture and communications, a post he held for five years. In documents that he submitted to set up the offshore company, he described himself as both a businessman and “public servant.”Under Djibouti’s constitution, holding the position of minister is “incompatible” with private sector activity.Ahmed did not respond to requests for comment.\",\n",

Members of his team had embezzled almost $180,000, according to a government audit, and he was dealing with the mess. Sipanje dismissed staff members and appeared before the country’s legislature to apologize for fraud on his watch.He still had time to open a company in the UAE.On Aug. 13, 2018, Sipanje wired 3,213 euros (about $3,664) from his bank in Lusaka to SFM to create Atlantic Commodities Investment Ltd., according to emails and invoices in the Pandora Papers. He paid an additional $360 to open a bank account in Dubai.“See attached swift advice,” Sipanje wrote to SFM, typing on his iPad and referring to an identification code for the system that allows banks to send and receive money internationally.To help SFM confirm his identity, one of the service provider’s obligations under UAE due diligence rules, Sipanje shared recent bank statements. In 2018, the statements show, Sipanje spent almost $2,000 at Louis Vuitton and about $1,050 for a helicopter ride provided by a firm that specializes in sightseeing trips over Victoria Falls and the Zambezi River.In a curriculum vitae shared with SFM, Sipanje did not mention any government employment. At the time, he was paid about $37,000 a year as the top public official in the Lusaka region. Leaked records show SFM’s own research identified Sipanje as being involved in Zambian politics.Sipanje owns a company in Zambia with a name similar to that of its UAE counterpart, Atlantic Commodities Ltd. According to public records, the Zambia company held licences to explore almost 64,000 acres for gold and other minerals near the country’s border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Sipanje’s Zambian company applied for its first mineral license on Sept. 26, 2018 — a month after he created his UAE firm.Sipanje was unapologetic about his use of the offshore system.“I do hope to one day wear a crown of a billionaire,” he told Zambian media in October after the publication of Pandora Papers news reports.In a follow-up interview, Sipanje told ICIJ that the UAE company was never operational and that he never opened a bank account. He said he has since asked SFM why its records indicated that he had.“Dubai is where the whole world goes,” Sipanje said. “Everyone who wants to do business, wants to be in Dubai.”Earlier this year, Zambia’s president dismissed Sipanje from his position as the chief bureaucrat of the country’s northern region. In August, his bid for a seat in Parliament failed. Now a private citizen, Sipanje told ICIJ that he will soon visit Dubai to finish setting up his company there.“In Zambia, we’ve got everything in terms of minerals. Where do you sell your commodities?” he asked. “All the big boys in Africa have to deal with Dubai.”Contributors: Hayatte Abdou (Comoros), Mahamoud Djama (La Voix de Djibouti), Charles Mafa and John Mukela (Makanday, Zambia), Lyas Hallas (Twala.info, Algeria) and Ntibinyane Ntibinyane (INK Center for Investigative Journalism, Botswana), Atanas Tchobanov (Bivol.bg, Bulgaria)Senior reporter and Africa coordinatorHelp us change the world.

But currently, only 500 industrial units are catering to the population of 105 million.Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Oscar Kimanuka, a Kigali-based political analyst, said corruption, lack of commitment, and political will on the part of the Congolese post-independent leaders were the main reasons leading to the downfall of industries.The political instability that started with the assassination of Patrice Emery Lumumba, the first prime minister, just a year after the independence also put roadblocks towards investments in the industries.“Industrialization was no longer a priority. Extraction of various minerals for the benefit of the West and a few selfish individual leaders became a priority for the governments,” said Kimanuka.He said only a few basic industries involved in processing minerals and other primary products for local consumption could survive.Now with President Felix Tshisekedi, who took over in 2019 unveiling the package known as the 2040 Master Plan for Industrialization, experts say the plan will not materialize in the wake of conflicts ragging the country.The eastern parts of DR Congo have been witnessing conflict with multiple foreign and local armed groups mushrooming in recent years.Nearly 500 civilians have been killed in North Kivu and South Kivu alone since the beginning of this year, according to the Kivu Security Tracker, a monitor focused on violence in eastern DR Congo.“Before this ambitious (industrial) project can take off, there is an urgent need to restore peace and security in the vast Central African nation. Peace and security are primary prerequisites to any nation's prosperity, including industrialization. Putting the cart before the horse cannot be realistic,” Kimanuka said.- Peace mandatory for a revival planKimanuka said only in an environment of peace and security there is hope to revive industrialization.The plan aims to achieve the objective of industrial growth and transform DR Congo, according to Congolese Industry Minister Julien Paluku.He said that over the next five years, the government wants to double the number of industrial production units from 500-1,000 and reduce import bills estimated at nearly $6.5 billion per year by 60%.To implement the plan, the government has split DR Congo into six industrial zones.These include the west in the Kinshasa region, the south in the former Katanga, the central zone in the Kasai area, the east zone in the three Kivu provinces, the northeast zone which includes the former Orientale province, and the north-west zone made up of the former Equateur.These industrial zones are expected to be transformed by 2040 into export hubs to neighboring countries.GREGORY BUTENGWA, Lusaka\",\n",

It is therefore widely felt that the US, as one of the superpowers, should have mainly focused on controlling epidemic prevention and helping improve growth, and not to defend freedom and democratic values.Of course the call for a democracy summit in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic leaves much to be desired and has surprised, if not disappointed, many stakeholders across the globe.African people have faced many problems in their lives over the two years of the dreadful disease. They have bought food and medicine with their limited living expenses,struggling to survive.They seek jobs regardless of dignity. However, this is a time when America, the largest democracy in the world, is talking about ideologies, instead of helping out the people in underprivileged countries.What do people need those ideologies for, if they find difficulty in living? This really confuses them.Of course democracy and freedom is good, but it cannot bring people any substantial benefits now. It is ridiculous to talk about these ideologies now when African people’s survival is in question, when survival is the first priority in Africa today.Among the countries President Biden has invited for the virtual democracy summit are Israel and Taiwan, which Beijing claims to be part of its territory, the move which is likely to further tension between the US and China.“I agree Taiwan more than qualifies – but it does seem to [the] democratic government that the US government does not officially recognise. So its inclusion is a big deal,” tweeted',\n",

Unsurprisingly, according to the guest list published on the US State Department’s website, America’s main rivals China and Russia are not on it.In Europe, Poland is represented despite recurring tensions with Brussels over respect for the rule of law,but Hungary far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban is not. On the African side,Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Niger are invited.“For this kick-off summit,there is a case for getting a broad set of actors into the room: it provides for a better exchange of ideas than setting a perfect bar for qualification,” Laleh Ispahani of the Open Society Foundation told AFP. Other than using the democracy summit as antiChina meeting, Ispahani urged Biden to address “the serious decline of democracy around the world – including relatively robust models like the US”.The summit is being organised as democracy has suffered setbacks in countries where the US had placed great hopes.Sudan and Myanmar have experienced military coups,Ethiopia is in the midst of a conflict that could lead to its “implosion”,according to US diplomats, and the Taliban took power in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of SU troops after two decades.Many stakeholders have questioned if the summit is just a talk show or it can effect change.But according to the Biden administration, the two-day virtual meeting is designed to help renew democracy around the world.The summit, the administration claims,will “focus on challenges',\n",

billionaire Dan Gertler in 2017 for corruption in Africa. In Donald Trump’s final days in office, they were rolled back with no explanation.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Eric LiptonWASHINGTON — In early December, an Israeli billionaire named Dan Gertler made an unusual request to the Treasury Department.A mining magnate who had been accused for years of corruption in deals he struck with leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr. Gertler had been slapped with stiff sanctions by the Trump administration in 2017, effectively cutting off his access to the international banking system and freezing money held in U.S. banks.He had unsuccessfully tried since then to get the sanctions rolled back by hiring high-powered lobbyists and lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, who had represented President Donald J. Trump in his first impeachment trial, and the former F.B.I. director Louis Freeh.But with time running out on the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration unlikely to give his pleas much of a hearing, Mr. Gertler put one last offer on the table: He would agree to have outside monitors track his business and submit regular reports on his financial transactions if the United States would lift the sanctions.The response came in mid-January, with only days left in Mr. Trump’s term: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin granted Mr. Gertler much of what he wanted, signing off, without any public announcement, on a one-year arrangement that gave him access to money frozen in U.S. banks and allowed him once again to do business with financial institutions worldwide.The decision stunned and angered American diplomats in Washington and Africa and government officials and human rights activists in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Mr. Gertler had been accused years earlier by the United Nations and other groups of working with the then-ruling family on deals that looted the nation’s mineral wealth and propped up a corrupt regime.And it has left the Biden administration scrambling to determine how Mr. Gertler managed to pull it off — and whether it can be reversed.The episode has echoes of Mr. Trump’s last-minute grants of clemency to political and personal allies and people with connections to him, including the involvement of Mr. Dershowitz. It also highlighted Mr. Gertler’s use of high-powered connections in Israel, including people with ties to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and an effort to win support from the U.S. ambassador to Israel.But the outcome was also distinguished by the secrecy of the process, which cut out the American diplomats most directly responsible for dealing with Congo and fighting corruption in Africa and appeared to have been handled largely at the level of Mr. Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The decision became public only after Mr. Trump had left office.The abrupt reversal of policy toward Mr. Gertler was extraordinary in a number of ways, an investigation by The New York Times found.Among the findings:The rapid decision to grant Mr. Gertler much of what he wanted defied Treasury Department norms, according to three former agency lawyers, effectively rolling back sanctions with no public documentation justifying the move and without broadly consulting officials at the State Department or the National Security Council. Only last year, some American diplomats and members of Congress in both parties were seeking to expand the sanctions on Mr. Gertler.Mr. Gertler tested the limits of federal law by hiring lawyers who also worked as lobbyists in Washington to push his case, including Mr. Dershowitz, who was instrumental in winning clemency from Mr. Trump for an array of clients, and Mr. Freeh. Treasury rules generally prohibit people under sanctions from spending money on lobbyists in the United States.The Treasury Department’s decision to grant Mr. Gertler a special license was based in part on an assertion that there was a “national security interest” for the United States in Mr. Gertler’s business dealings in Africa, lawyers involved in the effort and Israeli officials said. But some State Department officials were skeptical that his security value could outweigh the human, economic and moral damage contained in the allegations against him. It is also unclear how the balance could have shifted since sanctions were imposed in 2017.Pressure also came from Israel, where Mr. Gertler is represented by prominent lawyers including Boaz Ben Zur, whose client list also includes Mr. Netanyahu. David M. Friedman, then the U.S. ambassador there, was targeted in the push, and then notified Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Pompeo that he supported the sanctions relief Mr. Gertler wanted, assuming the Treasury Department could work it out.“I am astounded by this,” said John E. Smith, who served as the director of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control at the time the sanctions were imposed on Mr. Gertler. “It appears to be an abuse of the process.”Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Pompeo, who was also said to be supportive of the decision, both declined to comment.Mr. Gertler, in a statement, said the decision was not a result of any special influence campaign in Israel or the United States, but instead his promise to be more transparent about his business operations worldwide.“We will be adopting and implementing the most stringent anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies and measures across all our global practices,” Mr. Gertler said.But diplomats and human rights activists said they could see no justification for giving a break to Mr. Gertler, who was described by the Treasury Department in 2018 as “engaged in the looting of natural resources and the humanitarian consequences” that followed in poor, strife-torn Congo.Senior State Department officials in the Trump administration — including Michael Hammer, the U.S. ambassador to Congo; J. Peter Pham, a special envoy; and Tibor P. Nagy, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs — were not informed ahead of time of the move to grant Mr. Gertler the license, contrary to normal practice.“Here you have one of the most poverty-stricken nations, with a population that has suffered incredibly over the last several decades, and we have worked to turn that around, so why do this?” said Mr. Pham, who until Jan. 20 served as a senior State Department adviser on Africa.Mr. Gertler arrived in Congo in 1997 as a 23-year-old diamond dealer, determined to challenge the global giant in supplying raw diamonds, the South African-based De Beers. One of his first big breaks came about three years later, when Laurent Kabila, then the president of Congo, needed weapons to wage a war that would last for more than a decade.Offering monopolies to foreigners looking to tap into Congo’s rich mineral resources was a way for Mr. Kabila to raise cash needed to fight the war. Among them was a deal to export diamonds with Mr. Gertler, who was considered an appealing intermediary because of his ties to generals in the Israeli Army that could help Congo procure weapons, according to two reports issued by the United Nations in 2001. (Mr. Gertler disputed the findings.)But the U.N. concluded that Mr. Kabila used money gained selling access to the nation’s mineral wealth — including his deal with Mr. Gertler — to expand the Congolese military forces, a move that helped popularize the terms “conflict diamonds” and “blood diamonds.”“Conflict diamonds are exchanged for money, weapons and military training,” a U.N. report describing Mr. Gertler’s work said.Mr. Gertler was also indirectly accused, in a Justice Department court filing in 2016, of paying more than $100 million in bribes to government officials in Congo on behalf of a company named Och-Ziff “to obtain special access to and preferential prices for opportunities in the government-controlled mining sector.”A spokesman for Mr. Gertler, Aron Shaviv, said Mr. Gertler was never interviewed or charged in the case and he denied any wrongdoing. Instead, Mr. Shaviv said, Mr. Gertler’s companies have directly invested more than $1.5 billion in Congo, becoming one of the nation’s largest employers and taxpayers, starting when no other foreigners were willing to take the risk of doing business in the middle of a war.“He did buy cheap and he may sell at a much, much higher price because he made the investment when no one else did, no one else would dare go to Congo,” said Mr. Shaviv, a political consultant who served as Mr. Netanyahu’s campaign manager in 2015.Mr. Gertler first came onto the radar of White House officials in 2002, when Joseph Kabila, who took over the nation after his father was assassinated the prior year, sent a letter to President George W. Bush, looking for help to end the war.“Please accept my appointed emissary, Mr. Dan Gertler, a respected and well-known international businessman, to speak on my behalf for the needs of the Democratic Republic of Congo,” Mr. Kabila wrote in the April 2002 letter to Mr. Bush, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times.Correspondence from 2002 between Joseph Kabila, then president of Democratic Republic of Congo, and President George W. Bush about Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining executive.“He played a very pivotal role in not only advising Kabila, but also sort of speaking with authority and definitely carrying the United States’ message,” Jendayi E. Frazer, who then served as an adviser to Mr. Bush for African affairs, said in an interview.Mr. Gertler’s work helped lead to a peace deal in 2003. And it also cemented his relationship with Joseph Kabila. The Congolese government began to grant new deals to Mr. Gertler and his growing empire of companies, which expanded from diamonds into copper, cobalt, oil, gas and gold.In just five deals negotiated between 2010 and 2012 to sell copper and cobalt through offshore companies linked to the Fleurette Group, which is controlled by Mr. Gertler and his family, the citizens of Congo lost an estimated $1.36 billion because the nation’s resources were being sold at one-sixth of their value, according to a report prepared in 2013 by Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary general, and other prominent African officials.The forgone revenues to Congo from the deals “were equivalent to more than double the combined annual budget for health and education,” the report concluded.In Congo, over 70 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty, with an income of less than $1.90 a day. But the profits generated for Mr. Gertler were extraordinary, averaging 512 percent, according to the study, turning him into one of the 29 youngest billionaires in the world, according to Forbes.It was not just Mr. Gertler who was reported to be becoming tremendously wealthy through these deals.Joseph Kabila, who had called Mr. Gertler “an old and trusted friend,” was also taking a cut, according to a 2017 report by the nonprofit Congo Research Group, which found that Mr. Kabila and his family ended up as owners in part or whole of at least 80 companies. Among them was one mining deal with a business linked to Mr. Gertler that drew so many questions from the International Monetary Fund that the fund canceled disbursement of more than $200 million in loans it had planned to make under an agreement with Congo.The corruption and exploitation inherent in these types of deals were just the sort that a new appointee at the Treasury Department named Sigal P. Mandelker was determined to confront when she was confirmed as the top official in charge of sanctions enforcement in 2017.“Our objective is to change behavior, inspire democracy and freedom, and disrupt the ability of kleptocrats, human rights abusers and others from stealing the wealth of their country,” Ms. Mandelker said in a 2019 speech.Ms. Mandelker drew bipartisan praise for her effort to take advantage of new authority Congress granted to the Treasury in 2016. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, as the law is known, is named after a Russian tax lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after he exposed corruption by Russian officials.The new law allowed the Treasury to freeze the assets of individuals or businesses operating anywhere in the world that were engaged in “gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.”Working with the State and Justice Departments, Ms. Mandelker’s team included Mr. Gertler in the first round of individuals penalized in December 2017, citing his record of “opaque and corrupt” mining and oil deals in Congo. A second round of sanctions in 2018 targeted more companies affiliated with Mr. Gertler.The sanctions on Mr. Gertler severely constrained his ability to do business around the world by cutting off his access to the United States banking system and limiting his access even to non-U.S. financial institutions concerned about running afoul of the American law.But less than a year after the sanctions were imposed, Mr. Gertler began his campaign to roll them back.The push started with a seemingly innocuous request: Grant Mr. Gertler permission to use some of his money to make charitable donations to hospitals, libraries and schools in Congo. But even that plan drew concern from some State Department officials, who were worried that the donations would allow Mr. Gertler to bolster his standing in Congo and help supporters of Mr. Kabila, by then out of office, challenge efforts by the new, democratically elected president, Félix Tshisekedi, to assert control.By last year, Mr. Gertler was also battling to rebut a report by two human rights groups citing what they said was evidence that he was evading the sanctions by using a network of shell companies, frontmen and proxy bank accounts to move millions of dollars in and out of Congo and even to acquire new mining rights there.Mr. Gertler sued both the human rights groups and the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which published reports detailing the allegations. Lawyers working for Mr. Gertler and a bank in Congo claimed the reports were based on documents that were stolen and then tampered with. The paper and the human rights groups have defended the accuracy of their reporting.Instead of supporting Mr. Gertler’s bid for permission to make charitable donations, State Department officials responsible for Africa pressed the Treasury Department to expand the sanctions.But by the end of 2019, key players at the Treasury, including Ms. Mandelker, had started to leave the Trump administration, and State Department officials like Mr. Pham said they found it more difficult to get new Magnitsky sanctions imposed.The officials turned to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for help in keeping up the pressure on Mr. Gertler. In August, members of the committee sent the Treasury Department a bipartisan letter that did not mention him by name but carried a clear message.To help build democracy and fight corruption in Congo, the letter said, the United States “should designate additional officials and companies responsible for or complicit in high-level corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, for targeted financial and travel sanctions.”But Mr. Gertler’s team, including Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Freeh, had a different message. They had solicited a letter from Ms. Frazer attesting to Mr. Gertler’s role in the peace negotiations nearly two decades earlier and distributed it to Trump administration officials. As far back as 2019, they set up meetings with State Department officials, making the case that his activities had helped the interests of the United States.“His first effort was a lobbying effort,” Mr. Shaviv said of Mr. Gertler’s campaign.But Treasury rules state that “professional services such as lobbying, public relations, government affairs, consulting and business development are not legal services, and are generally not covered” by an exemption that allows people under sanctions to hire lawyers.Mr. Dershowitz said the meetings were permitted because he did not lobby the White House or others on this matter.“My role was purely limited to the legal issues,” Mr. Dershowitz said.But with time running out on Mr. Trump’s tenure and the sanctions still not lifted, Mr. Gertler decided to make a strategy shift. While not admitting any past wrongdoing, Mr. Gertler’s lawyers told the Treasury Department in early December that he was prepared to take any reasonable steps to assure the United States that he would abide by the law, including hiring outside monitors and submitting detailed periodic reports on financial transactions.“Our entire approach was to assure them that going forward, there would be no problem,” Mr. Shaviv said.At the same time, assertions were being made that Mr. Gertler had been of value to U.S. intelligence agencies.“It’s absolutely the case that the national security interests of both Israel and the United States were implicated in this,” Mr. Dershowitz said, although he and others declined to provide any specifics. Mr. Shaviv declined to discuss whether Mr. Gertler had undertaken any such activities, but said that if they did take place, they would be described as “services rendered to the United States of America.”Whatever Mr. Gertler did that benefited the United States was sensitive enough that Israeli officials said they were aware of it but declined to comment on its nature. Two Israeli officials told The Times that the United States had informed Israel that in line with a decision by Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Pompeo, the terms of the sanctions imposed on Mr. Gertler would be eased “out of reasons of American national security.”But several former State and Treasury Department officials said that while as a foreigner operating in Congo Mr. Gertler might have had information the United States considered valuable, keeping him on the sanctions list also had a value to Washington by helping to promote the anti-corruption effort.“The only value to national security that Gertler has comes from him being placed in the box that he was put into with the sanctions,” Mr. Pham said.In any case, the decision to grant him the one-year license was unusual in a number of respects, they said.The Treasury Department traditionally agrees to revoke sanctions only after individuals have proved they have already changed their behavior, not simply agreed to make such changes in the future, said Mr. Smith, the former head of the sanctions unit, who is now a national security lawyer at the law firm Morrison and Foerster. Mr. Gertler had not previously provided the United States such evidence.Furthermore, if Mr. Gertler’s assets in U.S. banks were going to be unfrozen and his corporate entitles allowed to once again do business with United States financial institutions, as the license allowed, that kind of deal would almost certainly need to be made public, not issued in secret as this one was. This kind of review also typically takes months of effort, not the six weeks that it took in this case.“This is a unique, one-of-a-kind response that you don’t see with the United States government,” Mr. Smith said of the so-called specific license that Mr. Gertler received. “It is the most shocking license I have ever seen in a few decades of working on economic sanctions.”When word of the decision to grant Mr. Gertler the one-year license eventually trickled out after Mr. Trump left office, it set off a firestorm of criticism from officials who said it would undercut efforts by the United States to fight corruption.Mr. Hammer, the U.S. ambassador to Congo, was at first \\u200bso \\u200bconfused at the news, according to one State Department official briefed on the matter, \\u200b\\u200b\\u200bthat he\\u200b called officials in Washington to figure out if \\u200ba \\u200bmistake had been made.“This has made my job much tougher\\u200b\\u200b,” an angry Mr. Hammer told colleagues.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bHouse and Senate Democrats fired off letters to the Treasury and State Departments. A coalition of 30 Congolese and international human rights groups assailed the move, with one of the letters calling the move a “terrible blow to the heart of one of the most lauded and effective anti-corruption programs of the last decade.”The Biden administration is now investigating why the license was issued, and if it could be revoked, although Mr. Gertler’s team said that it would have no justification to take such a step.Mr. Gertler, meanwhile, has begun a campaign to rehabilitate his image in Congo, releasing promotional videos detailing his work to support local hospitals and schools there and calling the citizens of Congo “brothers and sisters.” He also started a plan to allow residents of Congo to invest in one of his new mining projects.Activists in Congo were not impressed.“How can someone who has done so much harm to Congo for 20 years suddenly say he’s an angel?” said Jimmy Kande, a leader in the nonprofit group Congo Is Not for Sale. “If Congolese authorities would finally look at Gertler’s past, he shouldn’t have much of a future in Congo.”Kenneth P. Vogel, Lara Jakes and Julian E. Barnes contributed reporting.Advertisement',\n",

investment promotes confidence building peace spotlighted upcoming great lakes investment trade conference rwanda host november information media official record': \"8884TH MEETING (AM)Through a presidential statement, the Security Council urged signatory states of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as regional organizations and the international community, to coordinate their efforts to undercut the economic lifelines of armed groups that benefit from the illegal exploitation and trade in natural resources, and to prevent the exploitation of women and children in the trade of these resources.By the text (document S/PRST/2021/19), presented by Kenya, Council President for October, the 15‑member organ stressed that there is no purely military solution to the threat posed by armed groups, and that their elimination will require an integrated and regional approach by Governments in the region, with the support of United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and the Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General for the Great Lakes Region.It condemned continued illicit exploitation of and trade by armed groups and criminal networks in natural resources in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region, particularly in so-called “conflict-minerals” like tin, tantalum, gold and diamonds as well as cocoa, timber and wildlife.  As well, it condemned the negative impact of armed conflict on protected natural areas, which undermines lasting peace and development for the Great Lakes Region.  Further, it recalled that individuals and entities involved in destabilizing activities through the illicit exploitation or trade in natural resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may be designated by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004).Huang Xia, Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General for the Great Lakes Region, presented the Secretary‑General’s latest biannual report on the implementation of the 2013 Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region (document S/2021/836).  He noted that, despite progress, challenges remained, including an upsurge in attacks by armed forces that were destabilizing the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Such violence exacerbates the already fragile humanitarian situation, he said, adding that the armed groups are financed by the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources.Putting an end to the activities of these negative forces is “an old question that haunts everyone interested in the region”, he observed.  However, despite such persisting challenges, countries in the region remain committed to peace and development, he said, highlighting a workshop recently co-organized by his Office in Khartoum, which helped generate 31 recommendations “both ambitious and realistic” geared towards ending the link between the smuggling of some high-value minerals and the financing of armed groups.Martha Ama Akyaa Pobee, Assistant Secretary‑General for Africa, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, while shedding light on the deteriorating humanitarian situation and the heavy toll on civilians, particularly women and children, also spotlighted the commitment by the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to provide adequate resources for the disarmament, demobilization, community recovery and stabilization programme that was recently established.  Success of this national programme will contribute tremendously to sustainable peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she said, calling on international partners and donors to also support these efforts.João Samuel Caholo, Executive Secretary of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, pointed out that peacekeeping missions in the region have a fundamental role in reducing the criminal exploitation of natural resources and contributing to stability and economic recovery.  Such missions, he said, should participate in joint security efforts to dislodge rebel and militia groups from mining sites where armed groups use such revenues to finance conflict, and entrust those sites to Government institutions, rather than national security forces.Speakers throughout the meeting expressed concern over an upsurge in violent attacks in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Many emphasized the need to tackle the root causes behind the conflict — the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources — which fuels the activities of armed groups, thereby destabilizing the region and worsening the humanitarian situations.Tunisia’s representative, who was one among many voicing such concerns, stressed that the region’s wealth should become the driver of development, not a source of funding for the armed groups.Meanwhile, the representative of France underscored the need for tighter regulation and monitoring of the exploitation of gold, stating that the Security Council should sanction individuals and entities involved in the exploitation of natural resources.In a similar vein, Colm Brophy, Minister for Overseas Development and Diaspora of Ireland, pointed out that “competition for control of resource-rich areas fuels hostilities and violence.”  Such challenges were further exacerbated by climate change, population displacement, extreme poverty, socioeconomic inequality and a lack of opportunities for young people.Téte António, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola, noting that his country assumed the Presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region in November 2020, drew attention to the high-level diplomatic initiatives to strengthen cooperation in security matters.  A Contact and Coordination Group has been established by Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda with the task of coordinating the implementation of non-military measures to complement military operations against negative forces in the region, he said.Niger’s representative, along with other delegates, commended the increase in diplomatic efforts among leaders in the Great Lakes region to address issues ranging from the exploitation of natural resources to the flow of refugees.  Encouraging the Central African Republic to increase the transparency of its disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation plans, he applauded the recent ceasefire declaration, calling it “an act of political courage”.The representative of Burundi, for his part, commended all the efforts that resulted in the removal of his country from the Council’s agenda, stating that his Government, elected in 2020, has devised a National Development Plan focussing on good governance, economic growth, social protection and national reconciliation.  However, economic development in the region is hobbled by a lack of funding, which if unaddressed may in turn undermine peace efforts, given the negative impact of climate change on development, he said.Claude Ibalanky Ekolomba, High Representative of the President and Coordinator of the National Monitoring Mechanism of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, outlined steps his Government has taken to stabilize the conflict in the eastern provinces to better implement its commitments under the Framework Agreement.  The state of siege imposed in Ituri and North Kivu earlier this year enabled progress in stabilizing the region, including the dismantling of networks that resupply the groups, and the release of hostages, among others.He urged countries in the region and the international community to adhere to the Framework Agreement in order to tackle the root causes of conflict, including through the combat of illegal exploitation of natural resources and arms trafficking.  Towards that end, President Félix Tshisekedi Tshilombo has forged economic cooperation with Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda, he pointed out, adding that he hoped the upcoming meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism on 8 December in Kinshasa will not be an “empty ceremony”, but will instead lend new momentum to the Agreement and spur participants to adhere to their commitments.Also speaking today were ministers, senior officials and representatives of Kenya, Norway, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Mexico, Estonia, Russian Federation, Viet Nam, the United States, India, the United Kingdom, China, Uganda and Rwanda.The meeting began at 10:09 a.m. and ended at 1:25 p.m.BriefingHUANG XIA, Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General for the Great Lakes Region, presented the biannual report on the Implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region (document S/2021/836), covering the period from 16 March to 15 September.  Recalling that the countries of the region remain committed to peace and development and look to the international community to support their efforts, he said the report takes into account both the progress made and the challenges that persist.He welcomed the continuing political dialogue between countries of the region, noting that the increase in State visits have spurred bilateral relations and revitalized cooperation in realms including security, trade, infrastructure, transport, natural resources and energy.  He highlighted encouraging political and symbolic gestures, including meetings between the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his counterparts from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, as well as the continued commitment of the President of Angola — the current Chairman of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region — to support national reconciliation efforts in the Central African Republic.He also welcomed the peaceful elections in Zambia and the subsequent smooth transfer of power, as well as Kenya’s contribution of troops to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) to help defeat armed forces rampant in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  As part of these efforts, the launch of the Contact and Coordination Group aims to incentivize the surrender and voluntary disarmament of armed groups, he said, adding that such measures will complement the efforts led by the Democratic Republic of the Congo through its Disarmament, Demobilization, Community Recovery and Stabilization Program.Despite such progress, challenges remain, he noted.  There has been an upsurge in attacks by armed forces, including those destabilizing eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Résistance pour un État de droit au Burundi (RED Tabara), which attacked the Bujumbura airport last September.  Such violence exacerbates the already fragile humanitarian situation and affects socioeconomic stability, he said, adding that the armed groups are financed by the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources.  Ending these negative forces is “an old question that haunts everyone interested in the region”, he commented, spotlighting the workshop on natural resources in Khartoum from 31 August to 2 September that his Office co-organized.  This event helped generate 31 recommendations “both ambitious and realistic” which aims to put an end to the link between the smuggling of some high-value minerals and the financing of armed groups.  In addition, his Office and the Conference will work to sensitize countries of transit and destination of such minerals to support efforts to bring such activities to a halt.Turning to the COVID‑19 pandemic, which has compounded the region’s prevailing socioeconomic fragilities, he underlined the low rate of vaccines administered in the region and reiterated the Secretary‑General’s call for greater solidarity with developing countries.  His Office developed an inclusive action plan last July aimed at facilitating vaccine access and bolstering existing health systems.  He reiterated his commitment to working with relevant United Nations bodies in the region, as well as with the Peacebuilding Fund, to ensure the plan’s full implementation, and called on the Council and the international community for their support.Such positive developments in the region can be attributed to initiatives aiming to fulfil objectives designated through the 2006 International Conference on the Great Lakes Region Framework Agreement, he said, underlining the importance of countries in the region implementing recently signed bilateral agreements and commitments made through regional and international instruments.  In this context, he welcomed upcoming summit meetings including the tenth Regional Oversight Mechanism summit in Kinshasa in December.JOÃO SAMUEL CAHOLO, Executive Secretary of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, said that the Conference has made progress in peace, stability and development despite the heinous criminal activity in the region, including the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources and increased sexual violence by armed groups.  The Conference’s recent meetings — including that on the security and political crisis in the Central African Republic — demonstrate that it has become a regional platform to address inter‑State tensions.  The Conference’s commitment to deepen and consolidate democracy in the region is further evidenced by “the organization of peaceful and credible elections in Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania, Congo and Zambia”, as well as increased participation by women in decision‑making bodies, he said.Turning to peacekeeping missions in the region, he said that such missions play a fundamental role in reducing the criminal exploitation of natural resources; contributing to stability and economic recovery; and enhancing the technical capacity of national authorities and local security forces in their management of local resources.  Peacekeeping missions should participate in joint security efforts to dislodge rebel and militia groups from mining sites where armed groups use such revenues to finance conflict.  Those sites should be placed in the hands of Government institutions, rather than national security forces.  He also stressed that the international community must play a role in strengthening cross-border security and combatting transborder crime and terrorism.  For its part, the Conference is working to establish an early warning system for the region to share information in real time.On disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation plans, he called on the international community to provide technical and financial support for such efforts — including intensive peace education and economic empowerment for ex-combatants — as these initiatives depend on reliable funding streams.  These programs must ensure that targeted communities benefit from them, he stressed, adding that they should be linked to broader national reform.  Though costly, they have had positive effects on building social cohesion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Burundi and the Central African Republic.  Even more could be achieved in the Great Lakes region, he noted, if the sharing of information and coordination between borders is enhanced.  He also called on all stakeholders to help attract investment in the region, design programs to create youth employment and support the Conference’s mineral-due-diligence efforts.MARTHA AMA AKYAA POBEE, Assistant Secretary‑General for Africa, Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, said that the persistent insecurity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo east remains one of the main challenges facing the region today.  National and foreign armed groups continuing to perpetrate deadly attacks against civilians, further deteriorating the already dire humanitarian situation.  Since the beginning of this year, at least 1,043 civilians have been killed, including 233 women and 52 children.  This in turn shed light on underlying causes of the conflicts in the region, including, among others, the presence of foreign armed groups, the illegal exploitation of natural resources, intercommunal tensions, limited State presence in remote areas, marginalization and exclusion, youth unemployment and poverty.Governments of the region continue to prioritize military operations as part of their efforts to address the threat posed by armed groups in eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she continued.  She commended President [Félix Antoine] Tshisekedi Tshilombo’s decision to establish an operational centre in Goma to enhance cooperation between MONUSCO and the FARDC in the conduct of intelligence-driven operations against armed groups in Ituri and North Kivu provinces.  These military operations should be conducted in strict compliance with the human rights due diligence policy.  However, all initiatives must translate into actions.  In that regard, she welcomed the adoption of a three‑year action plan of the Contact and Coordination Group aimed at neutralizing the “negative forces” through a non-military approach.  MONUSCO and the Office of the Special Envoy will continue to support this Group through the establishment of an operational unit to be hosted in Goma.She also commended the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for their commitment to provide adequate resources for the disarmament, demobilization, community recovery and stabilization programme that was recently established.  Success of this national programme will contribute tremendously to sustainable peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she said, calling on international partners and donors to also support these efforts.  Among the main root causes of conflict are the illegal exploitation and regional trafficking of natural resources, which not only contribute to finance armed group networks but also creates parallel economy at the expense of States’ revenues.  The path towards sustainable peace and development also requires the meaningful participation of women, youth and the private sector.  MONUSCO and the Office of the Special Envoy will continue to ensure the participation of women and youth in local political and peace processes and work with the United Nations country team to support peacebuilding and stabilization efforts within the framework of the peace-development-humanitarian nexus.StatementsRAYCHELLE OMAMO, Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Kenya and Council President for October, spoke in her national capacity, observing that few parts of the world exemplify the notion of “paradox” than Africa’s Great Lakes region.  Home to the second largest rainforest and a critical lung for the planet, the region is the catchment area for Africa’s largest rivers and lakes and a habitat of impressive biodiversity.  As well, the Great Lakes region is endowed with a vast and unmatched array of precious and rare minerals as well as a rich pool of oil reserves and other hydrocarbons.  However, a great disconnect exists between the region’s potentials and the reality of pervasive poverty, underdevelopment and instability that has plagued this area for centuries.  This is due, in part, to an incessant cycle of brutal extraction, illicit exploitation, pillage and trafficking of the region’s natural resources.“We are here today to reinvigorate and renew the Council’s commitment to support the regional Governments,” she stated.  Proposing five courses of action, she said that first, capacity‑building and other assistance must be provided to resource-endowed countries to enable the development and implementation of policies, strategies and mechanisms for managing natural resources.  Second, enhanced support should be provided to national security and law enforcement agencies for improved security around the mining regions, transit routes and border areas.  Third, platforms for inclusive dialogue must be created to rebuild trust and confidence between mining communities, local authorities, extraction entities and merchants.  Fourth, regional countries should work together to deploy a range of military and non-military options to deal with armed groups.  The non-military measures may include disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration programmes for the ex-combatants.  Fifth, she called for greater regional cooperation to deepen the economic integration of the affected countries with a special focus on the productive utilization of national resources.COLM BROPHY, Minister for Overseas Development and Diaspora of Ireland, recognizing progress in the region, underlined the centrality of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework and expressed hope that the upcoming meeting of its oversight mechanism will help maintain the current momentum.  He also welcomed the United Nations Strategy for Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention, and Conflict Resolution.  However, he noted his concerns over the illegal exploitation and trade of minerals and natural in the region.  “Competition for control of resource-rich areas fuels hostilities and violence,” he said, adding that climate change, population displacement, extreme poverty, socioeconomic inequality and the lack of opportunities for young people are also exacerbating challenges.  Calling for good governance approaches and cooperation, he said Ireland will continue supporting the Kimberley Process Certification scheme and implementing the European Union’s Conflict Minerals Regulation, among others.  Action is also needed to address the region’s humanitarian and displacement crises, he said, also urging all parties to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance.NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) emphasized that enhanced regional cooperation must translate into specific action for the protection of civilians in the Great Lakes region, including humanitarian actors that are still victimized by armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It is also important to ensure coordination among security actors on the ground and with MONUSCO.  Further, he stressed the need to contain the illegal exploitation of natural resources — a main cause of instability — as this helps finance armed groups and criminal networks, feeds conflict and compounds tensions between States.  Gold exploitation, in particular, is not sufficiently monitored and must be more tightly regulated.  To that end, the Council must sanction individuals and entities involved in natural resource exploitation.  He also stressed that, as MONUSCO transitions, United Nations agencies should enhance their presence in the Great Lakes region, and donors should mobilize to support implementation of the United Nations regional strategy and to meet humanitarian needs.MONA JUUL (Norway) noted the positive advances in cooperation in the Great Lakes region, including on action against armed groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  It is vital that the United Nations and the global community support those efforts, she stressed, adding that the adoption of the Strategy for the Great Lakes Region and its accompanying Action Plan are a good starting point.  However, the illicit trade of natural resources in the region, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually, is a root driver of conflict, draining public revenue and seriously impacting States’ ability to protect and provide for their populations.  She expressed hope that the endorsement of the recommendations by Heads of State at the upcoming International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, together with existing mechanisms, can contribute to curbing revenue streams to armed groups and advancing the transparent and sustainable management of natural resources in the region.INGA RHONDA KING (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) urged that continued efforts ensure women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all stages of the political, peace and development processes.  Expressing concern over the volatile security situation in the region, including the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic, she welcomed President [Faustin-Archange] Touadera's unilateral declaration of a ceasefire as a fundamental step towards the implementation of the Peace Agreement and called on all parties to follow suit.  Highlighting the humanitarian situation across the region, she pointed to a significant number of internally displaced people, with many experiencing food insecurity.  She called for sustained support, including through contributions to the relevant humanitarian response plans.  Voicing her hope regarding the United Nations Strategy for Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution in the Great Lakes Region, she also urged States to address the root causes and drivers of endemic violence, particularly the illegal exploitation and trade of natural resources.JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMIREZ (Mexico) welcomed the achievements of regional diplomacy, including the normalization of relations between Burundi and Rwanda, and the strengthening of ties between the latter country and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  While underscoring the positive effects these regional dynamics have had on peace and security — including the revitalization of the political agreement in the Central African Republic — he pointed out that significant challenges remain; those are a result of the actions by armed groups that produce security issues and hinder the provision of humanitarian assistance.  Tackling the root causes of violence must be a priority and robust action must be taken to address the exploitation and trafficking of natural resources.  Further, he stressed that more specific efforts must be implemented to combat the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons, adding that policies to manage arms and munitions must complement the broader strategy of disarmament and demobilization.TAREK LADEB (Tunisia) noted that the region is witnessing political, economic and security challenges, which are being exacerbated by the COVID‑19 pandemic.  Noting that the pillaging of natural resources finances the activities of armed groups, he stressed that the region’s wealth must become the driver of development, not a source of funding for the armed groups.  Emphasizing the importance of full implementation of the regional peace and security framework, he welcomed the regional summit of Heads of State held in Uganda in September as an opportunity to pull their efforts together.  Paying tribute to the work of the Special Envoy, including his good Offices and assistance in capacity‑building, he also underscored the long‑term value of the United Nations Strategy for Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution for the Great Lakes region.  He lauded the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund, reaffirmed support for regional organizations, including the African Union, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the East African Community, and endorsed the Presidential Statement adopted today.SVEN JÜRGENSON (Estonia) said the insecurity over two decades in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo destabilizes the region, leading to day-to-day killings of civilians, as well as conflict-related sexual violence, “behaviour unworthy of human beings”.  The conflict in the region has plunged the population in a dire humanitarian situation and has left them experiencing critical levels of food security.  “It is inconceivable that about 15 million people in the region are subjected to forced displacement,” he stressed, adding, that this should not happen to populations in these times.  He underlined the importance of greater regional cooperation to consolidate control over conflict minerals and mining sites and welcomed efforts towards regional cooperation and dialogue by countries in the region in this regard.  He encouraged the implementation of regional databases on mineral flows as well as the harmonization of regional regulations.  He also called for the strengthening of the national disarmament, demobilization and stabilization programme, spotlighting the role of investigative authorities and regional courts in addressing accountability for illegal exploitation of natural resources.ANNA M. EVSTIGNEEVA (Russian Federation) said the situation in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo remains challenging, observing that while the situation in Tanganyika Province has been stabilized, armed groups such as the Allied Democratic Forces continue to be active in North Kivu.  More is needed to be done to ensure the extraction of minerals takes place in an orderly manner.  She also noted that exclusively military means will not bring about lasting normalization of the situation in the region.  She took note of positive steps taken by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to resolve border disputes, and to implement disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programmes for former combatants.  She also welcomed heightened diplomacy efforts by countries in the region and commended the role played by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region under the presidency of Angola in supporting such efforts.  The successes underscored her country’s conviction that African problems must be addressed by African solutions, she stressed, adding that it is nefarious to try to impose ready-made formulas or interfere from the outside.ABDOU ABARRY (Niger) welcomed the recent increase in diplomatic efforts among leaders in the Great Lakes region to address issues such as the exploitation of natural resources and the flow of refugees.  Encouraging the Central African Republic to increase the transparency of its disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and rehabilitation plans, he called the recent ceasefire declaration “an act of political courage”.  Condemning armed groups’ attacks in that country, as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he welcomed regional efforts to end this violence.  Military action cannot be ruled out to resolve insecurity in the region; however, non‑military measures designed to address the drivers of conflict will help consolidate peace.  In this quest for peace in a region so vast and rich in natural resources, it is necessary to strengthen bilateral ties among countries in the region and ensure synergy between the various subregional organizations to which those States belong, he stressed.HAI ANH PHAM (Viet Nam), emphasizing the vital importance of regional cooperation in conflict prevention and resolution, said it also plays a central role in tackling the illegal activities of armed groups, the illicit exploitation of and trade in natural resources and the adverse impacts of natural disasters and the COVID‑19 pandemic.  Commending progress on regional cooperation in the Great Lakes region, he nevertheless said the humanitarian situation remains worrisome, especially in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  While welcoming the gradual return of refugees in Burundi, he expressed concern over the plight of millions of displaced people and refugees, as well as the more than 27 million people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that face crisis‑level food insecurity.  In that context, he encouraged the further intensification of cooperation to implement the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework, to strengthen management of nature resources and to tackle threats posed by armed groups.LINDA THOMAS‑GREENFIELD (United States) expressed support for the principles of the United Nations Peace Consolidation, Conflict Prevention and Conflict Resolution in the Great Lakes region and encouraged the Special Envoy to swiftly implement it through shuttle diplomacy.  She also welcomed the work towards establishing a regional oversight mechanism and Kenya’s focus on natural resources, adding that, as noted in the meeting, the illegal trade of natural resources is clearly fuelling violence in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Urging Governments in the region to uphold their commitments, she called for responsible management of natural resources, including due diligence for the private sector.  If regional State actors work together to carry out legal trade of natural resources, the difference will be extraordinary, she said.T. S. TIRUMURTI (India) said armed groups remain the main cause for insecurity in many countries of the region.  As well, the porous international borders remain a major impediment in combating these groups, he said, welcoming high-level regional diplomacy and the reinvigoration of the bilateral mechanisms to strengthen border control, sharing of information and intelligence and border infrastructure development.  The illegal exploitation, trafficking and illicit trade of natural resources have contributed to armed conflict in the region; existing systems and efforts at the regional level need be strengthened further to address the issue.  India has close bilateral relationships with all countries in the Great Lakes region.  A key driver of these relationships is the people-to-people contact that has existed for many years, he said, drawing attention to a large Indian diaspora in the region.  India has collaborated through exchange of experts, training and capacity building programs and enhanced support towards post-conflict reconstruction in the region, he noted.JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom) said the concept note for today’s meeting rightly identified the illegal exploitation and trade in natural resources as a key conflict driver and multiplier of destabilising forces.  He called on regional Governments to play their part by ramping up national efforts to tackle corruption and improve the rule of law and domestic taxation.  Expressing deep concern that the United Nations Group of Experts for the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been on hold since August, he said that this has prevented the Group from providing their concrete and actionable reporting on illicit smuggling of natural resources in the region.  While continuing to focus on natural resource exploitation, it is important to discuss and address other priority areas including but not limited to human rights, good governance, freedom of expression and civil liberties in the Great Lakes, he said.ZHANG JUN (China), stressed that peace and development in the region faces a window of opportunity.  Emphasizing the need to maintain the momentum of cooperation, he called on States to adhere to eliminate the root causes of conflicts.  The competition over natural resources was due to poverty and underdevelopment, he said, underscoring that countries in the region should strictly regulate and enforce the exploitation and utilization of natural resources; strengthen regional cooperation to combat their illegal exploitation and trade; and cut off the channels of illegal profits for armed groups.  He also pointed out that the COVID‑19 vaccination rate in the region is only 6 per cent and cited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that it will be difficult for countries in the region to return their per capita income to the pre-pandemic levels before 2025.  Calling for increased vaccine assistance to the region and pragmatic measures in debt relief and development assistance to help with pandemic response and recovery, he noted that 12 countries in the region are using Chinese vaccines.TÉTE ANTÓNIO, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola, recalled that his country assumed the Presidency of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region in November 2020, with an aim to enhance the Conference’s capacity to address the challenges of peace, security, stability, and development in the region, with the support of partners including the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations.  Despite the achievements under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement, the illicit exploitation of natural resources, tense relations between countries, refugees and internally displaced persons, humanitarian issues and growing terrorist threats continue to threaten the stability of the region.  As such, preventive diplomacy, sustainable development through the promotion of investments and increased participation of international financial institutions and the private sector are needed.He went on to say that as part of the high-level diplomatic initiatives to strengthen cooperation in security matters, a Contact and Coordination Group has been established by Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda with the task of coordinating the implementation of non-military measures to complement military operations against negative forces in the region.  However, the illicit exploitation and trade of natural resources is one of the key drivers of instability.  It is therefore of fundamental importance that the nexus between natural resources and conflicts must be brought to bear in the formulation of adequate responses and mitigation measures, he said.CLAUDE IBALANKY EKOLOMBA, High Representative of the President and Coordinator of the National Monitoring Mechanism of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said that despite formidable challenges, his country is determined to implement all its commitments under the Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework Agreement.  Recalling that President Félix Tshisekedi Tshilombo imposed a state of siege in Ituri and North Kivu earlier this year to counter the activities of armed groups, he outlined progress, including the neutralization of hundreds of militia members, the recovery of munitions, the dismantling of networks that resupply the groups, the release of hostages, a decrease in raids on civilians and the reopening of some roads previously under armed groups’ control.  Pointing out that a combination of military and non-military solutions is required to bring the situation under control, he called on the Security Council to express its support for the siege as well as other programmes his Government is undertaking, including disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programmes.Consolidating peace in the region entails tackling the root causes of destabilization, including through the combat of illegal exploitation of natural resources and arms trafficking, he continued.  In this regard, he called on countries in the region and the international community to adhere to the Framework Agreement, adding that President Tshekedi has forged economic cooperation with Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda.  The state of gridlock around the security situation must be overcome to achieve technical reforms laid out in the Framework, he stressed.  To this end, the National Monitoring Network has outlined a roadmap, which focusses on identifying and tackle the root causes of conflict, strengthening capacities at all levels, supporting national cohesion and strengthening national and regional cooperation.  He expressed his hope that the upcoming meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism on 8 December in Kinshasa will not be an “empty ceremony”, but will instead lend new momentum to the Agreement and spur participants to adhere to their commitments.ADONIA AYEBARE (Uganda) highlighted the region’s renewed sense of optimism in improved bilateral relations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbours — with a specific focus on addressing the root causes and drivers of conflict and instability.  Welcoming renewed cooperation between the countries, he said relations between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are excellent.  Another example of enhanced cooperation was the mini‑summit in October 2020 of the Heads of States of Uganda, Rwanda, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The Heads of State agreed to strengthen surveillance and control measures in response to COVID‑19 and other pathologies with epidemic potential; combine their efforts to eradicate the negative forces and armed groups; work together to stop the illicit exploitation and trade of natural resources; and consolidate cooperation to create economic opportunities, in particular trade facilitation and cross-border infrastructure.The United Nations and the Security Council must recognize the critical role played by regional mechanisms as building blocks in the promotion of peace, security and stability in the region, he continued.  Under the auspices of the East African Community, his country — working together with Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, and soon with the Democratic Republic of the Congo — is “razor‑focused” on improving the physical infrastructure in the region, thus greatly enhancing economic integration.  The United Nations and the African Union, as key guarantors of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region, have a unique role to play in enhancing their efforts to support the countries in the region, he said.ZÉPHYRIN MANIRATANGA (Burundi) commending all the efforts that resulted in the withdrawal of Burundi from the Security Council’s agenda, informed the 15-member organ that his country has restored peace and security and the Government, having come out of the elections in 2020, has put together a national programme towards building social stability and economic growth.  The National Development Plan of 2018‑2027 is centred on several pillars, including good governance, economic growth, youth employment, social protection, and peace and national reconciliation.  However, one of the issues in the region is a lack of funding needed to support economic development.Highlighting the clear link between peace and development, he said the negative impact of climate change on development could in turn undermine peace efforts.  Therefore, it is imperative to focus on mobilizing funding, he said, welcoming efforts by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.  He went on to congratulate the Special Envoy for his efforts towards lasting peace in the region and on his inclusive and participatory approach to elaborate the regional strategy and action plan.  He added that he hopes to see the international community support the Special Envoy in implementing the strategy.VALENTINE RUGWABIZA (Rwanda) welcomed today’s debate, which is occurring at a time when the countries of the Great Lakes region are facing the full‑blown socioeconomic impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic.  Despite these circumstances, foreign and domestic negative forces continue to operate in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Rwanda has faced several cross-border attacks from such forces — the latest of which occurred on 27 August.  She stressed that illegal trade in arms and natural resources allow these negative forces to continue to organize, recruit new combatants and obtain new equipment.For the Great Lakes region to unleash its full potential for development and prosperity, the armed groups and negative forces operating in the region must be neutralized and the materiel supply networks that fuel them must be cut, she said.  Further, increased cooperation on security and development between Member States of the Great Lakes region will make an immense contribution in this regard.  “The good news is that this is happening,” she pointed out.  Noting that cross-border trade and investment promotes confidence-building and peace, she spotlighted the upcoming Great Lakes Investment and Trade Conference, which Rwanda will host in November.For information media.

yard of his house, on the outskirts of Kolwezi, a city in the southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. As the man later told neighbors, he had intended to create a pit for a new toilet. About eight feet into the soil, his shovel hit a slab of gray rock that was streaked with black and punctuated with what looked like blobs of bright-turquoise mold. He had struck a seam of heterogenite, an ore that can be refined into cobalt, one of the elements used in lithium-ion batteries. Among other things, cobalt keeps the batteries, which power everything from cell phones to electric cars, from catching fire. As global demand for lithium-ion batteries has grown, so has the price of cobalt. The man suspected that his discovery would make him wealthy—if he could get it out of the ground before others did.Southern Congo sits atop an estimated 3.4 million metric tons of cobalt, almost half the world’s known supply. In recent decades, hundreds of thousands of Congolese have moved to the formerly remote area. Kolwezi now has more than half a million residents. Many Congolese have taken jobs at industrial mines in the region; others have become “artisanal diggers,” or creuseurs. Some creuseurs secure permits to work freelance at officially licensed pits, but many more sneak onto the sites at night or dig their own holes and tunnels, risking cave-ins and other dangers in pursuit of buried treasure.The man took some samples to one of the mineral traders who had established themselves around Kolwezi. At the time, the road into the city was lined with corrugated-iron shacks, known as comptoirs, where traders bought cobalt or copper, which is also plentiful in the region. (In the rainy season, the earth occasionally turns green, as a result of the copper oxides beneath it.) Many of the traders were Chinese, Lebanese, and Indian expats, though a few Congolese had used their mining profits to set up shops.One trader told the man that the cobalt ore he’d dug up was unusually pure. The man returned to his district, Kasulo, determined to keep his find secret. Many of Kasulo’s ten thousand residents were day laborers; Murray Hitzman, a former U.S. Geological Survey scientist who spent more than a decade travelling to southern Congo to consult on mining projects there, told me that residents were “milling about all the time,” hoping for word of fresh discoveries.Hitzman, who teaches at University College Dublin, explained that the rich deposits of cobalt and copper in the area started life around eight hundred million years ago, on the bed of a shallow ancient sea. Over time, the sedimentary rocks were buried beneath rolling hills, and salty fluid containing metals seeped into the earth, mineralizing the rocks. Today, he said, the mineral deposits are “higgledy-piggledy folded, broken upside down, back-asswards, every imaginable geometry—and predicting the location of the next buried deposit is almost impossible.”The man stopped digging in his yard. Instead, he cut through the floor of his house, which he was renting, and dug to about thirty feet, carting out ore at night. Zanga Muteba, a baker who then lived in Kasulo, told me, “All of us, at that time, we knew nothing.” But one evening he and some neighbors heard telltale clanging noises coming from the man’s house. Rushing inside, they discovered that the man had carved out a series of underground galleries, following the vein of cobalt as it meandered under his neighbors’ houses. When the man’s landlord got wind of these modifications, they had an argument, and the man fled. “He had already made a lot of money,” Muteba told me. Judging from the amount of ore the man had dug out, he had probably made more than ten thousand dollars—in Congo, a small fortune. According to the World Bank, in 2018 three-quarters of the country’s population lived on less than two dollars a day.Hundreds of people in Kasulo “began digging in their own plots,” Muteba said. The mayor warned, “You’re going to destroy the neighborhood!” But, Muteba said, “it was complicated for people to accept the mayor’s request.” Muteba had a thriving bakery and didn’t have time to dig, but most locals were desperate. In Congo, more than eighty-five per cent of people work informally, in precarious jobs that pay little, and the cost of living is remarkably high: because the country’s infrastructure has been ravaged by decades of dictatorship, civil war, and corruption, there is little agriculture, and food and other basic goods are often imported. For many Kasulo residents, the prospect of a personal cobalt mine was worth any risk.About a month after the man who discovered the cobalt vanished, the local municipality formally restricted digging for minerals in Kasulo. According to Muteba, residents implored the mayor: “We used to mine in the bush, in the forest. You stopped us. You gave all the city to big industrial companies. Now we discovered minerals in our own plots of land, which belonged to our ancestors. And now you want to stop us? No, that is not going to work.” Muteba recalled, “People started to throw rocks at the mayor, and the mayor ran away. And, when the mayor fled, the digging really started.”Odilon Kajumba Kilanga is a creuseur who has worked in the Kolwezi area for fifteen years. He grew up in southern Congo’s largest city, Lubumbashi, which is near the Zambian border, and as a teen-ager he worked odd jobs, including selling tires by the roadside. One day when he was eighteen, a friend who had moved to Kolwezi called him and urged him to join a coöperative of creuseurs which roamed from mine to mine, sharing profits. “There were good sites that you could just turn up to and work,” Kajumba said, when we met in Kolwezi.In those days, it took eight hours to get from Lubumbashi to Kolwezi by bus, on a rutted two-lane road. The thickets on either side of the highway crawled with outlaws, who occasionally hijacked vehicles using weapons they’d leased from impoverished soldiers. Once, bandits stopped a bus and ordered the passengers to strip; the hijackers took everything, even people’s underwear.Kajumba knew that the journey to Kolwezi was dangerous, but he said of the creuseurs, “If they tell you to come, you come.” At first, the work, though strenuous, was exciting; he began each shift dreaming of riches. He had some stretches of good luck, but he never made the big score that would transform his life. Now in his mid-thirties, he is a laconic man who becomes animated only when he is discussing God or his favorite soccer team, TP Mazembe. Mining no longer holds romance for him; he sees the work as a symptom of his poverty rather than as a path out of it. When you are a creuseur, he said, you are “obliged to do what you can to make ends meet,” and this necessity trumps any fears about personal safety. “To be scared, you must first have means,” he said.Kajumba joined the mining economy relatively late in life. In Kolwezi, children as young as three learn to pick out the purest ore from rock slabs. Soon enough, they are lugging ore for adult creuseurs. Teen-age boys often work perilous shifts navigating rickety shafts. Near large mines, the prostitution of women and young girls is pervasive. Other women wash raw mining material, which is often full of toxic metals and, in some cases, mildly radioactive. If a pregnant woman works with such heavy metals as cobalt, it can increase her chances of having a stillbirth or a child with birth defects. According to a recent study in The Lancet, women in southern Congo “had metal concentrations that are among the highest ever reported for pregnant women.” The study also found a strong link between fathers who worked with mining chemicals and fetal abnormalities in their children, noting that “paternal occupational mining exposure was the factor most strongly associated with birth defects.”This year, cobalt prices have jumped some forty per cent, to more than twenty dollars a pound. The lure of mineral riches in a country as poor as Congo provides irresistible temptation for politicians and officials to steal and cheat. Soldiers who have been posted to Kolwezi during periods of unrest have been known to lay down their Kalashnikovs at night and enter the mines. At a meeting of investors in 2019, Simon Tuma Waku, then the president of the Chamber of Mines in Congo, used the language of a gold rush: “Cobalt—it makes you dream.”After Kasulo’s mayor fled, many residents began tearing away at the ground beneath them. Some wealthier locals hired creuseurs to dig under their houses, with an agreement to split the profits. Two teams of creuseurs could each work twelve-hour shifts, chipping at the rock with hammers and chisels. A pastor and his congregation began digging under their church, stopping only for Sunday services.By the end of 2014, two thousand creuseurs were working in the neighborhood, with little regulation. Kajumba and his coöperative soon joined in the hunt for minerals. One man on Kajumba’s team, Yannick Mputu, remembers this period as “the good times.” He told me, “There was a lot of money, and everybody was able to make some. The minerals were close to the surface, and they could be mined without digging deep holes.”But the conditions quickly became dangerous. Not long after the mayor formally prohibited excavating for minerals, a mine shaft collapsed, killing five miners. Still, people kept digging, and by the time researchers for Amnesty International visited, less than a year after the discovery of cobalt in Kasulo, some of the holes made by creuseurs were a hundred feet deep. Once diggers reached seams of ore, they followed the mineral through the soil, often without building supports for their tunnels. As Murray Hitzman, the former U.S.G.S. scientist, pointed out, the heterogenite closest to the surface often contains the least cobalt, because of weathering. Creuseurs in Kasulo were risking their lives to obtain some of the worst ore.One of Kajumba’s teammates told me that their coöperative of six used to regularly extract two tons of raw material from a single pit in Kasulo. But most of the best sites were quickly excavated, and the yield from newer pits was less than half as much. The team was also ripped off by unscrupulous traders and corrupt officials. Kajumba said that lately he has struggled to pay his rent of twenty-five dollars a month. “Whenever we dig up a few tons, I send some money to my family,” he added.Drug and alcohol use are rampant among creuseurs. Kajumba said that, though many people he knew in Kasulo wasted all their earnings on narcotics, he avoided such temptations. Whenever I met up with him, he made a point of drinking a cola.Children who work in the mines are often drugged, in order to suppress hunger. Sister Catherine Mutindi, the founder of Good Shepherd Kolwezi, a Catholic charity that tries to stop child labor, said, “If the kids don’t make enough money, they have no food for the whole day. Some children we interviewed did not remember the last time they had a meal.”Researchers estimate that thousands of children work in mining in Kolwezi alone. Mark Canavera, a faculty member at Columbia University who focusses on child welfare, has spent time in Kolwezi. “I don’t think the government has any capacity to monitor children’s involvement in this,” he told me. “Even if it did, it doesn’t have a framework for thinking about what is child labor and what isn’t.” In such a poor region, parents often expect their children to supplement the family’s income, even if the work is dangerous.At a school run by Good Shepherd, I met Ziki, a serious boy with large dark eyes. He was fifteen but, because he had been malnourished for long periods, he looked much younger. His parents had been killed in a roadside accident when he was three; afterward, he was sent to live with his father’s sister. “My aunt sent her kids to school but sent me to the mines,” he said. “I was full of bitterness.” He joined a team of boys who roved across Kolwezi.I was initially skeptical that Ziki had begun working at such a young age, but Mutindi said that she has seen many such cases. “The younger children of four, five, six, seven, these will mainly be collecting—picking stones,” she said. “It’s amazing how they know the value.” Children are eventually given such jobs as washing ore or carrying heavy sacks of rocks to traders who loiter near the sites on motorcycles. When I visited Kolwezi, streams alongside the city’s main roads teemed with women and children washing minerals.As Ziki and his friends grew older, they began entering pits dug by creuseurs. The tunnels were square, four or five feet across, and about sixteen feet deep. It was infernally hot inside them, and oxygen was scarce. “As you were descending, there were rocks that you held on to,” he recalled. “If you held on to the wrong rock and it loosened from the wall, you would tumble into the hole. I would bump into older people who were going down into the pits, and they would tell us, ‘You children, if you enter you will die.’\\xa0”Ziki worked at mine sites around Kolwezi for eleven years. Although Congo’s government periodically claimed that it was cracking down on child labor, few adults tried to stop him from working. “Soldiers would hunt us,” he recalled. “If they caught you, they would beat you.” He went on, “If you sold your minerals, when you had money, there were street kids, thugs, who could stop you on the road and snatch your money. To pass safely, you had to pay five hundred francs”—about fifty cents—“so you could have safe passage. If you gave them nothing, they would beat you.”Copper has been mined in Congo since at least the fourth century, and the deposits were known to Portuguese slave traders from the fifteenth century onward. Cobalt is a byproduct of copper production. In 1885, Belgium’s King Leopold II claimed the country as his private property and brutally exploited it for rubber; according to “King Leopold’s Ghost,” a 1998 book by Adam Hochschild, as many as ten million Congolese were killed. But, because of local resistance and the inaccessibility of the region, large-scale commercial mining didn’t begin in the south until the twentieth century.Kolwezi was founded in 1937 by the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, a mining monopoly created by Belgian royal decree. These colonialists may not have matched the atrocities of King Leopold, but they still saw the country in starkly exploitative terms. They understood that the best way to extract Congo’s mineral wealth quickly was to create infrastructure. The company cleared the thickets of thorny acacias and\\xa0miombo trees that had grown atop Kolwezi’s rich mineral deposits and built the town across the area’s rolling hills, with wide streets and bungalows for Europeans, whose neighborhoods were segregated from those where Congolese workers lived. Locals were used to create this infrastructure, and to labor in the mines, but, as Hitzman put it, “the whites ran everything.”After independence, the southernmost province, Katanga, was viewed as a prize by Cold War powers. In the sixties, Katanga unsuccessfully tried to secede, with the support of Belgium and the Union Minière. Then, in 1978, Soviet-armed and Cuban-trained rebels seized Kolwezi and several hundred civilians were killed. Before the insurrection, the Soviet Union appeared to have been stockpiling cobalt, and, according to a report by the C.I.A., the attack set off “a round of panic buying and hoarding in the developed West.” Cobalt, the report declared, “is one of the most critical industrial metals.” Then, as now, the mineral was used in the manufacture of corrosion-resistant alloys for\\xa0aircraft engines and gas turbines.The West’s solution to the market instability was to prop up the country’s dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, who presided over an almost farcically kleptocratic regime. The country’s élite sustained themselves, in part, on the profits from the mines. Gécamines, a state-controlled mining company, ran a virtual monopoly in Katanga’s copper-and-cobalt belt, and owned swaths of the cities that had been built to house miners.By the early nineties, Mobutu and his cronies seemed to have stolen everything they could, and Congo was falling apart. As the country drifted toward civil war, the Army pillaged Gécamines, and former workers sold off minerals and machine parts in order to feed their families. In 1997, Mobutu went into exile. The disintegration of Gécamines transformed Congo’s mining landscape. Creuseurs began digging at the company’s largely abandoned sites, selling ore to foreign traders who had stayed behind after Mobutu was deposed.Congo became mired in a series of wars in which\\xa0more people were killed than in any other conflict since the Second World War. The country’s next leader, Laurent-Désiré Kabila, was assassinated, in 2001, and his son Joseph took over. Both Kabilas funded their war efforts by selling Gécamines sites to foreigners. By the time Hitzman arrived, in the mid-two-thousands, Gécamines had become a shell. “Some of the best geologists I’ve ever met in my life were still working for Gécamines, and hadn’t been paid for three years,” Hitzman said. “It was sad as hell.”Some creuseurs in Odilon Kajumba Kilanga’s collective used to work for Gécamines. Yannick Mputu, who is from Likasi, three hours east of Kolwezi, told me that he once reprocessed tailings at a company mine in his home town, adding, “When Gécamines closed, we had to go to Kolwezi.”The collective regularly sneaked into open-pit mines that are now owned by companies like the Swiss multinational Glencore. “We enter at night, we work, and leave early in the morning,” Mputu told me. He noted that creuseurs put something aside for the soldiers and the police who supposedly prohibit outsiders from entering: “We give them a percentage of our earnings, and they let us in.”In June, 2019, more than forty creuseurs were killed in a landslide after breaking into a Glencore-owned mine in Kolwezi. Kajumba and his friends were also at the site that night, but they were working a different seam. “The worst thing I’ve seen as a miner is the sheer number of dead bodies when there were cave-ins,” Kajumba said. The night after the Glencore landslide, a mining-company employee told me, “people snuck back in and continued digging.”Videos of Kasulo taken during the height of the 2014 cobalt rush show orange tarpaulins covering fresh pits and bags of minerals littering the streets. Michael Kavanagh, a journalist, visited the district a year later, and published an article in the Times observing that the profusion of holes made it look “as if it had been bombed.” At one point, after creuseurs tunnelled beneath the main road running west to Angola, the road collapsed.Kajumba and his team were part of this initial frenzy. They knew that picking at the rock beneath Kasulo’s sandy soil was treacherous, especially during the rainy season, but they were happy not to be risking arrest, as they were when they broke into the big mines. One day in December, 2014, Kajumba and other creuseurs were working a pit at Kasulo when they felt a rumble. “It was as if something was falling deep underneath us,” Kajumba recalled. They knew that, the previous day, a group of creuseurs working in a neighboring hole had asked a local chief to perform a ritual over a new area where they had been digging. Creuseurs, many of whom have little formal education and enter pits every day fearing that they might die, can be superstitious. Magic practitioners, known as féticheurs, are sometimes employed in the hope of increasing the chances that a fresh pit will contain bounties of cobalt and copper.Such rituals are often benign, but they can have a sinister side. Among the prevailing superstitions in the region is a belief that having sex with a virgin girl will enhance one’s luck in the mines. While I was in Kolwezi, Mutindi, of Good Shepherd, showed me photographs of the bruised corpse of an eight-year-old girl who had been abducted and raped by a creuseur the previous week. (The miner was later apprehended; she sent me a video of him in prison.) Children frequently die while being raped. In one case, Mutindi said, she saw the body of an eighteen-month-old infant who had been raped by a creuseur.At Kasulo, the féticheur who had performed the ritual over the neighboring pit had warned the miners not to enter it for three days, to avoid angering a dragon that, he said, lived at the bottom. The creuseurs were told that the pit would then be safe—and full of minerals. Rumors of the pit’s riches spread, and a day later some miners decided to disobey the féticheur. “Creuseurs have curiosity,” Mputu said. “They wanted to see what was down there.”After Kajumba and Mputu felt the ground shudder, they rushed to the neighboring hole. Part of the tunnel had caved in, trapping their neighbors deep below. Some fifty people vaulted into the darkness, desperate to save their friends. Rescuers nearly suffocated in the subterranean passages. Eleven of the trapped miners died, as did four rescuers.Following another series of féticheur rituals, and another period of waiting, all the bodies were pulled from the hole. Some were horrifically burned. “The last person who escaped from the pit said that he saw a huge flame,” Mputu told me. The fire’s origin was unclear, but artisanal miners can unearth pockets of flammable gas. To Mputu and his colleagues, the accident had supernatural trappings. “The cause of the flame was none other than the dragon,” he told me.Nine months after the cave-in, another group of creuseurs in Kasulo burned a tire in an underground gallery, in an attempt to crack open a stubborn rock face. Five people asphyxiated from the fumes; thirteen others were hospitalized. After the incident, Radio Okapi, a media group sponsored by the United Nations, interviewed Kolwezi’s mayor, who said that a year earlier he had sent a report to his superiors urging the closure of the artisanal pits. According to Radio Okapi, the mayor “expressed regret that no site was closed because of this request.” The report noted that more than a thousand holes had been dug in Kasulo.The Democratic Republic of the Congo was reorganized in 2015, and Kolwezi became the new capital of a region called Lualaba. The first governor of Lualaba, Richard Muyej Mangez Mans, promoted himself as Papa Solution. In Kolwezi, many benches at bus stops were painted with his nickname. In an interview with the magazine Mining and Business, Muyej spoke critically of the cobalt “contagion” in Kasulo. “A plan is needed to avoid hasty movements that could turn into a humanitarian tragedy,” he said. “We have made a project proposal that we will submit to the authorities.”The proposal, which Muyej didn’t disclose at the time, involved granting the mineral rights at Kasulo to a foreign company: Congo Dongfang International Mining, a subsidiary of Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese conglomerate that, among other things, has supplied materials for iPhone batteries. China is the world’s largest producer of lithium-ion batteries, and Huayou has made a huge investment in Congo. After acquiring mineral rights in the region, in 2015, it built two cobalt refineries. According to an internal presentation, by 2017 Huayou controlled twenty-one per cent of the global cobalt market. (A Huayou spokesperson said that Congo Dongfang followed international standards in developing Kasulo, and plans to “gradually eradicate all forms of human-rights violation with a responsible supply chain.”)China and Congo have a long history. During Leopold’s reign, Chinese workers were shipped to Congo to help build the national railroad. In the nineteen-seventies, Mobutu turned to Mao’s regime for technical collaboration on infrastructure projects. By the nineties, the Chinese were becoming the bosses: the Beijing government and myriad Chinese businesses began making heavy investments in Africa, particularly in resource-rich and regulation-poor countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Peter Zhou, a Chinese-born financier who has worked on a few mining deals in Congo, said that in such countries “there is corruption, there is lack of the rule of law, which gives you more autonomy to be entrepreneurial.” (Zhou emphasized that he hadn’t directly witnessed or engaged in corruption.) In 2007, Joseph Kabila made a six-billion-dollar infrastructure deal with China that included a provision allowing the Chinese to extract six hundred thousand tons of cobalt.The journalist Howard French, in his 2014 book, “China’s Second Continent,” writes that in Zambia, Congo’s neighbor, Chinese companies invested so extensively in copper mines that the flood of foreign money was said to be influencing elections. Beijing was blamed for increasing Africa’s debt burden, and an essay in the magazine New African accused China of “a new form of colonialism.”These days, most of the cobalt in southern Congo comes from industrial mines, which are largely owned by Chinese companies. In 2016, China Molybdenum paid the U.S. company Freeport-McMoRan $2.65 billion for a controlling stake in Tenke Fungurume, a giant copper-and-cobalt mine about two hours east of Kolwezi; three years later, China Molybdenum acquired another stake, for $1.14 billion. Zhou, who worked on the Tenke Fungurume deal, divided the current Chinese involvement in Congo into two phases. At first, he said, companies had to take significant financial risks, because “there was a lack of infrastructure—the cost base is high to transport all the materials.” They also had to pay bribes to government officials and Gécamines executives. During this phase, Chinese companies were incentivized to make money by whatever means possible. “If you conduct your business without, you know, a proper return, then you can’t justify the risk,” Zhou told me. During this period, he said, mines had few safety protections.With sufficient infrastructure in place, Zhou went on, the “Chinese are now\\xa0conducting business in a more moral way. They have to keep the people in a peaceful mind-set, so they started to build a social relationship—training locals in how to grow out their culture, their schools.” He continued, “There’s less gray conduct now, and more of a sort of transparent business.”In 2017, Chinese workers arrived in the village of Samukinda, half an hour northwest of Kasulo, and quickly constructed two dozen houses with corrugated-iron roofs. Kasulo residents were ordered to leave their neighborhood within two weeks. The Congolese government revealed that a mining permit had been granted to Congo Dongfang, which would remove the topsoil and then wall off what had once been the neighborhood. Creuseurs from an approved coöperative would be allowed to mine the site, and Congo Dongfang would become the exclusive buyer of Kasulo’s ore.Congo Dongfang offered the families of Kasulo either a lump sum for their plots—up to twenty-five hundred dollars—or a new home in Samukinda. A consortium of local organizations wrote to Governor Muyej, protesting that the evictions were illegal, but he pressed on. Muteba, the baker, told me that on a rainy day a couple of months later, employees of Congo Dongfang “came with huge trucks to crush our houses.”Around this time, Joseph Kabila announced that, after eighteen years in office, he would not run for reëlection. In January, 2019, Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo became President. The following spring, I met with Governor Muyej at his fortified compound in the center of Kolwezi. Muyej said that Tshisekedi would likely maintain the course set by Kabila—“a flight that we must take to get out of poverty.”Muyej told me that he hoped to diversify the local economy through tourism and agriculture. Mining, he said, exacerbated inequalities—“enormous mineral wealth beside a population that lives in enormous precarity.” In 2018, Forbes praised Muyej’s governorship as “a model for bringing together economic prosperity, political transparency and social impact.” Yet it’s hard to imagine Kolwezi becoming a travel destination anytime soon. On a recent trip there, I tried to visit Katebi Lodge, a new lakeside resort. At the entrance, a metal gate topped with barbed wire, I was shooed away by a police officer toting a Kalashnikov. Apparently, the lake was too polluted to allow visitors.Muyej often cited the building of a new governorate office—a gaudy structure rising above a sea of ramshackle cinder-block houses—to show how he had modernized Kolwezi. Renovations of the local soccer stadium and the town’s central roundabout, which features a statue of mine workers, were financed by mining companies.Muyej told me that he hoped to reform the mining sector, in part, by reducing child labor and by centralizing the market where traders buy cobalt, thus instilling transparency in the supply chain. Critics have called such reforms cynical bids to control and tax artisanal production for personal gain. Muyej, his family, and officials close to him have profited from the mining boom. The Governor’s son Yves is the C.E.O. of a logistics company in Kolwezi; on LinkedIn, one of his employees describes himself as the site supervisor of the Congo Dongfang mine. Muyej’s cabinet chief, Yav Katshung, is a lawyer whose firm does work for Congo Dongfang. (Katshung and Yves Muyej both declined to speak to me.)Muyej said that as many as a hundred and seventy thousand creuseurs work informally in his province. Among the forty or so sites where artisanal miners are employed as day laborers is the Congo Dongfang mine in Kasulo. Only eight hundred or so creuseurs work there, however, and that has stoked resentment. Jacques Kayembe, the president of an artisanal mining collective, told me, “Kasulo is a village that is built on mineral deposits, but not enough creuseurs can legally work on official artisanal deposits, and that’s a problem.”Whenever Muyej tried to reason with creuseurs who had sneaked onto industrial concessions, he was attacked with stones, and in 2019 there was so much unrest in Kolwezi that the military was sent in. It has become common to see soldiers carrying machine guns and rocket launchers around the city. When I first visited the area, in 2019, a toll booth outside the city was riddled with bullet holes. A local journalist travelling with me said that a policeman at the booth had recently been murdered by gangsters.Since the emergence of COVID-19, Congo’s south has endured a series of lockdowns. Kajumba said that creuseurs like him “continue to work, but the situation is difficult.” Companies have furloughed workers, adding to their frustration. Several months ago, a Congolese friend sent me a video of miners protesting for back pay at a Chinese-run mine in Kolwezi. As pandemic restrictions continued, my friend sent me footage of protesters burning tires in the streets.Last year, the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa announced that two Congolese citizens had leaked documents revealing numerous improprieties at Afriland First Bank, a Cameroon-based institution where Muyej had at least one account. Muyej, it was\\xa0revealed, had been\\xa0moving hundreds of thousands of dollars through the bank. He is now under investigation in Congo for corruption, and his vice-governor is running Lualaba. According to Radio France Internationale, the Congolese authorities have accused Muyej of not being able to justify forty per cent of his cabinet’s expenses. (A representative for Muyej said that the Governor had done nothing wrong, and welcomed an audit of his finances.)Huge sums of money continue to change hands in the region. In December, China Molybdenum paid Freeport-McMoRan half a billion dollars to acquire a controlling stake in Kisanfu, a copper-and-cobalt concession east of Kolwezi. At a recent conference sponsored by the Financial Times, Ivan Glasenberg, the C.E.O. of Glencore, said,\\xa0“China, Inc., has realized how important cobalt is.” He continued, “They’ve gone and\\xa0tied up the supply.” He warned that if Chinese companies stopped exporting batteries, this could hamper the ability of non-Chinese companies to produce electric vehicles. Last month, CATL, a Chinese conglomerate that develops and manufactures lithium-ion batteries, acquired a hundred-and-thirty-seven-million-dollar stake in the Kisanfu mine. Tesla works with the company to make its car batteries, and CATL has supplied batteries to Apple. Recently, according to witnesses at Kisanfu, a cave-in killed at least four creuseurs.In the spring of 2019, I visited the Congo Dongfang mine in Kasulo, escorted by company representatives. Signs by the gate said that children and pregnant women were forbidden to enter. Inside the compound, the land that had once been a bustling neighborhood was now a giant red crater. (I saw no children during my visit, but Kajumba told me that they still find their way in.) My minders cautioned me not to wander too close to the creuseurs, as they were liable to be violent. Not long before my arrival, a group of them had set some company trucks on fire.Kajumba said that Congolese had been employed to mediate between the creuseurs and company officials. Often, the creuseurs’ demands were not met and they went on strike. “You go in to work and say, ‘No, I won’t do anything,’\\xa0” Kajumba said. “The Chinese will feel unsafe and call in the police.” The police, he said, do the company’s bidding: “They know they will get a gift from the Chinese, so they will threaten you with teargas and batons.” Kajumba said that he had been teargassed by police at Kasulo: “Everyone ran to save his life. We felt defenseless.”At some sites, the treatment of Congolese by their Chinese bosses is reminiscent of the colonial period. In a video shared with me by Mutindi, of Good Shepherd, a Congolese guard with a Kalashnikov slung across his back beats a man who is lying, semi-naked, in mud, his arms bound. Behind the camera, a man otherwise speaking Mandarin starts yelling “Piga! ”—the Kiswahili word for “beat.” In the background are seven of the trucks that Congo Dongfang uses to transport cobalt ore.Upon my arrival at the mine, I had been given a long explanation of safety protocols, but as I approached the creuseurs it was clear that they had only rudimentary equipment. Plastic jerricans, cut roughly in half and tied to ropes, were being used to haul ore. Many creuseurs were shoeless, and I saw none wearing helmets or goggles, despite the fact that a confidential 2018 audit, by the Korean conglomerate LG Chem, had criticized the site for a lack of proper safety equipment.Some creuseurs washed ore in dirty ponds by the pits. “The Chinese are cheating us,” one of them murmured. “They’re telling us the ore is less pure than it is.” Kajumba said that he had stopped working at Kasulo six months earlier because he felt that he was being treated unfairly. “It’s as if you were working to suffer even more,” he told me.In a warehouse at the site, I watched a man, his face grim, pulverizing ore on a concrete floor as two Chinese overseers scrutinized creuseurs from behind a barrier of chicken wire. No Chinese employee interacted with me, and nobody responded when I waved in greeting.One night in Kolwezi, I went to a Chinese-run casino with a few Congolese friends. I was immediately allowed inside, but they were stopped at the door and told that they could not gamble. Black Africans, the casino’s staff explained, can’t be trusted with money. At a roulette table, a host of drunken white South Africans addressed a Congolese croupier as “Black man.”It’s unclear how many Chinese live in Congo, though estimates range from fewer than ten thousand to as many as a hundred thousand. Before the pandemic, Ethiopian Airlines’ daily flights from Addis Ababa into Lubumbashi were filled with Chinese passengers. When these workers arrive in a mining town, signs in Mandarin guide them to Chinese-run hotels, shops, and restaurants. Outside work, the Chinese rarely mingle with the locals. Very few of them know French or Kiswahili, the most commonly spoken languages of Congo’s south. In a 2017 essay, the Congolese political scientist Germain Ngoie Tshibambe wrote that many Chinese find their time in Congo lonely and difficult. “It is no paradise for migrants,” he noted.Few locals patronize Chinese restaurants, which tend to be relatively expensive and not to their taste, but Chinese health clinics have become popular. The clinics offer a rare opportunity for casual social interaction—perhaps more so than at the mines themselves. In 2011, Jean Jolly, a French journalist, reported that one of Congo Dongfang’s directors of external relations had never visited the mine that he represented, two miles away.Congolese who work at Chinese-run mines said that their supervisors were often racist. A Congolese translator who speaks Mandarin told me, “Chinese people are coming here for business to make money, so they can never be our friends.” He had overheard Chinese employers saying of the Congolese, “These people, they don’t really think.”Creuseurs around Kolwezi frequently complained to me that Chinese-owned mines had replicated the harsh conditions of China’s own mining industry. Congolese often say, “If they work without shoes there, how can they be expected to give us shoes to work here?” A Western mine official told me he had visited a mine in Congo, owned by a small Chinese company, that had many Chinese laborers. It reminded him of an internment camp: “The Chinese were barefoot, they were digging with shovels, and they couldn’t leave.”Peter Zhou, the Chinese-born financier, referred to the locals in Congo as his “Congolese brothers,” and argued that many big Chinese-run mines in the region had implemented strong safety standards. Recalling his first visit to southern Congo, Zhou said, “I wasn’t too surprised about the poverty, because I grew up in Shanxi Province, in the interior of China.” When he met with Congolese families in roughly constructed homes, he was reminded of the cinder-block rooms of his youth.Zhou acknowledged that there was “a lot of corruption” in Congo’s mining sector, but he maintained that, with\\xa0enough economic prosperity, the gray economy in Congo will fade, much as it has in China. “My Western friends come to it and say, ‘There are significant risks associated with business here,’\\xa0” he said. “I see something familiar.”During one of my visits to Kolwezi, Kajumba invited me to the cramped room that he shares with Yannick Mputu and Mputu’s brother, Trésor. I followed Kajumba down an alley in one of the town’s sprawling working-class neighborhoods. We entered a courtyard, hung with drying linens, that smelled strongly of sewage, then passed through a green doorframe covered with printed fabric.Inside, the walls were painted various bright colors. Above a bed facing an old cathode-ray television was a rack of neatly pressed suits, shirts, and jackets, many with natty checks and patterns. Even though Kajumba struggles to get by, he keeps up with the latest fashions. On the day that I visited, he was wearing an orange gingham button-down paired with a black-and-white-speckled baseball cap.Creuseurs take pride in the ingenuity required to do their job well, and some of them told me that they like the irregular working hours. But Trésor Mputu, who has two children living in Likasi, told me, “As a father, I wouldn’t accept\\xa0my son going to the mines.” Yannick nodded. “I would want, through my labors, to enable my children to go further,” he said. “I want them to be able to study in good conditions, and for them to be able to\\xa0leave the country to develop themselves.”Even if artisanal mining supports poor families in the region, it’s hard to applaud it. The lives of most creuseurs are short and marked by suffering. Many have physical and psychological injuries from mine collapses and other accidents, and from violent confrontations with the police and the Army. Ziki, the former child creuseur, recalled an incident that took place when he was about twelve: “One Friday, we were sitting down, and soldiers came into the mine—they caught us. They threw us to the ground. They sprayed us with water and then began to whip us. We began to cry and ask for mercy. And we swore to them that we would never come again to this place.”Soon afterward, Ziki left his group of friends, who had begun drinking and smoking heavily, and wandered around mine sites by himself. He began sleeping at sites, eating little and being abused by soldiers. At one point, he was taken hostage by older creuseurs who accused him of stealing their wares. In a stroke of luck, members of a CBS News crew met him while he was washing minerals. They encouraged his family to take him and his siblings out of the mines. “They asked my grandmother, ‘Aren’t these children capable of studying?’\\xa0” he said. “My grandmother promised to take us back to school.” (CBS viewers donated money for their schooling.)I asked Ziki what he thought of people who profited from cobalt mining. “I have sadness in my heart when I think of people who buy the minerals,” he said. “They make so much money, and we have to stay like this.” When I told him that Americans paid more than a thousand dollars for the latest iPhone, he replied, “It really hurts me to hear that.”The companies that use lithium-ion batteries periodically respond to public pressure about the conditions in cobalt mines by promising to clean up their supply chains and innovate their way out of the problem. There is also a financial incentive to do so: cobalt is one of a battery’s most expensive elements.Last year, Tesla pledged to use lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, which do not contain cobalt, in some of its electric cars. Huayou stock plummeted. Still, Reuters noted, “it was not clear to what extent Tesla intends to use L.F.P. batteries,” and the company “has no plans to stop” using batteries that contain cobalt. (L.F.P. batteries aren’t used in cell phones: to achieve the required voltage, the batteries would have to be doubled up, adding unacceptable bulk and heft.)After Amnesty International published a report on unethical cobalt mining, in 2016, Apple issued a statement saying that it “believes every worker in our supply chain has a right to safe,\\xa0ethical working conditions,” and that “underage labor is never tolerated.” The following year, after a report by Sky News showed that cobalt mined by children was still being used in the company’s devices, Apple suspended purchases of hand-mined cobalt, but once the media attention died down the practice continued. Huayou remains part of Apple’s supply chain.In December, 2019, attorneys from International Rights Advocates, a law firm in Washington, D.C., sued Apple, Google, Dell, Microsoft, and Tesla for involvement in the injuries or deaths of child miners. “These boys are working under Stone Age conditions for paltry wages, and at immense personal risk, to provide cobalt,” the complaint alleges. “The hundreds of billions of dollars generated by the Defendants each year would not be possible without cobalt mined in the D.R.C.”Terry Collingsworth, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, believes that the brutal conditions must have been apparent from the start. “I can’t imagine that a company like Apple would become dependent\\xa0upon a supply chain without having spent quite a bit of time on the ground,” he told me. In response, Apple said that it had been improving standards since 2014 and contended that it is “constantly working to raise the bar for ourselves, and the industry.” It also said that it had made innovations in cobalt recycling. (In August, 2020, the companies being sued jointly filed a motion to dismiss, and in October the plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition.)The outcry over working conditions has led industry players to found the Fair Cobalt Alliance, an organization that, among other things, supports small-scale mining with safety equipment and clean water. The group is now present at Kasulo and at another site. Glencore, Huayou, and Tesla have joined the alliance.Ziki, who is now in school, likes\\xa0studying and playing soccer, and administrators have given him basic supplies to take home to his family. When I asked him what he hoped for in life, he replied, “I have the hope that I can become the governor!”One Sunday morning, I met Kajumba and Trésor Mputu at the Temple Évangélique de Carmel, a hangar-style megachurch in the center of Kolwezi. The sign outside proclaims that it is the “thirtieth Pentecostal community in Congo.” Kajumba and Mputu attend\\xa0services every Sunday. “When someone finds themselves in difficulties, they can come to the church, they can pray,” Kajumba said.Inside, people swayed and sang, their hands outstretched. A few congregants spoke in tongues. On a stage covered with flowers, one of the pastors declared that the church was “worth more than any enterprise.” He promised that spiritual riches awaited even his poorest parishioners.After church, Kajumba, Mputu, and I went to a local bar to watch the broadcast of a soccer match between a Malagasy team and TP Mazembe, which is passionately supported throughout the south. When Mazembe scored the first goal, Kajumba smiled. Suddenly, the television crackled, and the programming switched to another game, in Kinshasa, the nation’s capital. “They always forget us down here in the south,” someone\\xa0said. Kajumba sighed and said that he should probably head home.One day, driving north out of Kolwezi, I noticed how deeply faith permeated everything around me: the Mount Carmel health clinic, the Salon Apocalypse hairdresser, the Light of God tire shop. Eventually, the road became unpaved. Trucks carrying sulfuric acid threw up plumes of dust as they trundled toward factories where raw minerals are processed.I turned onto a side road and crossed a creek where men, women, and children were washing cobalt ore. On the other side lay a cluster of mud-brick houses. This was Samukinda, the village where new houses had been built for the exiled residents of Kasulo.The sun was punishingly hot that day, and I was grateful when Nama Mavu, the local chief, invited me into her home for a chat. “My ancestors came from Angola, and they set up the village in 1941,” she said. On her parlor wall there was an image of Jesus, and a poster advertising a copper-and-cobalt mine. “My ancestors came here to build the railroad, and, when the construction of the railroad finished, they stayed.”For years, the villagers farmed the surrounding bush, growing large crops of manioc, but about a decade ago the land became polluted after some foreign businessmen opened a cobalt-processing plant nearby. This left no source of employment for the villagers, except as low-paid day laborers. In 2018, the residents of Kasulo who had been displaced by the\\xa0Congo Dongfang mine began to arrive.As I walked through the village, children laughed and pointed at me, shouting “Chinese! Chinese!” Mavu said that the villagers were seldom visited by foreigners, even though their factories and mines now surrounded the town. She assigned two young men to escort me to the houses that Congo Dongfang had built. A row of modern-looking white buildings rose in the distance. As they came into focus, it was clear that their construction was slapdash.Few of the homes were even occupied, as most of the original residents of Kasulo had accepted money instead. Those families who had chosen to take a house had been shown a brochure with beautiful pictures. But the homes turned out to have no electricity or bathrooms. The roofs leaked, and the well at the corner of the development was dry. Most of the families moved away.Muteba, the baker, was one of the few arrivals from Kasulo who had remained in Samukinda. Now in his seventies and retired, he wore a soiled lab coat over his emaciated body. He welcomed me into his house, which was stifling hot. The roof was only roughly attached to the walls. He had dug himself a lavatory pit, which was covered with a board. “The water here, it’s not good,” he said. “The smell of acid and pollutants comes out of any hole we try to dig for water.”Muteba, who was ill with diarrhea, wistfully recalled his home in Kasulo. “It was a big parcel of land,” he said. “It had at least fifteen trees—avocado trees, mango trees. All this was mine.” He continued, “We were chased out of our homes like animals, and now we suffer like strangers.”Mavu told me that her village can hardly support its own inhabitants, much less the new ones from Kasulo. She has no means of transport, and Governor Muyej has refused to come and see her in order to take stock of the village’s problems. She asked me to change about twenty dollars’ worth of Zambian money that she had carefully folded away after making a trade with food importers. There is no school at Samukinda, and the nearest shops are miles away.During my meeting with Governor Muyej, I raised some of the complaints I had heard at Samukinda. He insisted that I had “a bad comprehension of the issues.” He promised to address the dry well and the poor housing construction. When I returned to the village, five\\xa0months later, Mavu told me that Papa Solution still hadn’t sent anyone: “All that has changed is that I am older.”At the end of my first visit to Samukinda, I noticed mining tailings spread across a path. The residents had put them there to check erosion during the rainy season. I wondered if the tailings contained any cobalt, and a young villager told me that they probably did—after all, the entire region rested on mineral deposits. I then asked him if the residents of Samukinda had considered digging beneath the village. The young man shrugged and said that the people in his village didn’t want to suffer the same fate as those in Kasulo. Then he made a prediction: “In the end, they will come and kick us out of here.”\\xa0♦By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.SectionsMore© 2021 Condé Nast.

meaningfully join fight corruption': 'Translations:Photo: i_am_zews on ShutterstockBy Paul Banoba, Africa Regional Advisor at Transparency InternationalJacob Zuma, former South African president, is currently sitting behind bars in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Facing corruption charges, Zuma defied court instructions to testify as part of the state capture inquiry, triggering a 15-month prison sentence.Zuma is one of the few African heads of state to have faced corruption charges in their own country. His resignation in 2018 and subsequent investigations are the victory of the people of South Africa, powered by civil society, courageous media and vigilant courts. The events unfolding in South Africa therefore contain lessons for the whole region. Corruption, especially high-level and grand corruption, has been a significant barrier to democratic governance, human rights protection and sustainable development across Africa. Recognising this threat, on this day 18 years ago, the African Union adopted the African Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption (AUCPCC) in Maputo, Mozambique. Since 2017, countries across the region have marked 11 July as the annual African Anti-Corruption Day. Transparency International’s 28 national chapters in Central, East, North, West and Southern Africa commemorate the fifth African Anti-Corruption Day with a call to action to the governments and the African Union. Read the letter in French | Read the letter in ArabicJudging by the anti-corruption commitments of the African Union, governments across the region appear keen to address corruption. So far, 44 out of 55 African countries have ratified the AUCPCC. As required by the Convention, countries have established national anti-corruption laws and institutions. Almost every country now has a dedicated government agency responsible for fighting against corruption. Furthermore, many countries have specialised agencies for specific anti-corruption areas like financial intelligence to address money laundering and illicit flows; integrity agencies to address conflict of interest and illicit enrichment, among others. Corruption, however, appears unmoved and Africa remains as the region most burdened with it. Unscrupulous public officials across the region have been exposed as the easy targets of multinational companies – like Glencore, Odebrecht and Semlex – that resort to bribery in exchange for lucrative government contracts and license deals. Further, the region continues to suffer massive outflows of its resources through illicit financial flows, reducing the ability of African governments to provide basic services to their citizens. With the little resources available, public service provision is also rife with corruption. More than one in four African citizens have to pay a bribe to access basic services.On African Anti-Corruption Day 2019, Transparency International released the tenth edition of Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Africa. The survey, conducted in partnership with Afrobarometer, revealed that more than half of all citizens surveyed in 35 African countries thought corruption is getting worse in their country. Fifty-nine per cent of people think their government is doing badly at tackling corruption.These trends have a long-term impact on Africa’s stability, and on her efforts to reduce poverty among her population. Projections indicate that Africa will keep lagging behind all other regions. The latest World Bank report on global poverty trends indicates that extreme poverty will be a predominantly African problem in the coming decade. Commemorating Africa’s fifth Anti-Corruption Day, the African Union is calling on regional economic communities and other stakeholders, including civil society and media, to support the implementation of the AUCPCC. This is a welcome development. Some of Africa\\'s regional economic communities have regional anti-corruption measures that complement and reinforce provisions of the AUCPCC. The African Anti-Corruption Day provides a good opportunity to reflect on progress so far. This reflection should involve citizens.Notably, the AUCPCC requires the countries that have ratified the convention to report annually on their progress in implementing anti-corruption measures. Transparency International recently conducted a comparative review on the implementation and enforcement of the AUCPCC. Our findings indicate that most African countries do not report on their implementation as required. Furthermore, only a few exceptions – like Ghana and Rwanda – have established dedicated processes to involve civil society in their reporting measures. Our report assesses the state of implementation of the AUCPCC in 10 countries: Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Tunisia. It focuses on four key areas of the convention: money laundering, illicit enrichment, political party funding and civil society and media. African citizens are willing and ready to contribute to the fight against corruption, provided they are safe in doing so. According to Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer – Africa 2019, 53 per cent of citizens believe that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption. In countries like Eswatini, Lesotho and the Gambia, between 65 and 71 per cent of citizens believe that their voices matter. Citizen activists, journalists and whistleblowers play a crucial role in the anti-corruption fight. They help expose weak points that require government action, and sometimes uncover evidence of corruption that requires follow-up actions from the state’s anti-corruption agencies. Given the governments’ stated commitment to anti-corruption, they should only welcome their contribution. Despite citizens’ readiness to contribute to the fight against corruption in Africa, 67 per cent of African citizens fear retaliation if they report corruption. It therefore becomes urgent that African governments address legal protections of these willing citizens, activists, journalists and whistleblowers as crucial partners in this joint fight against a common challenge. While most people in Africa feel corruption increased in their country, a majority also feel optimistic that they, as citizens, can make a difference in the fight against corruption.States should also engage with their citizens on how to contribute to solutions. The AUCPCC requires States Parties to “create an enabling environment for civil society and the media to hold governments to the highest levels of accountability in the management of public affairs.\" It further calls on States Parties to \"ensure and provide for the participation of civil society in the monitoring process of the Convention.\" Furthermore, Article 9 of the AUCPCC requires States Parties to adopt measures for citizen’s right of access to information in order to assist in the fight against corruption. To-date, half of the member states of the African Union have not enacted specific laws on the right of access to information. This substantially limits public engagement.On this African Anti-Corruption Day, governments should take the opportunity to tell their people what they are doing against corruption. Proactive publishing of relevant data on corruption can serve to inspire citizens to hold their governments to account. What measures have been taken? What are the achievements so far? Which public resources have been so far recovered in this fight? What are the amounts involved? Who was held to account? Where are they now? People need answers to meaningfully join the fight against corruption.',\n",

your entire organization.The Democratic Republic of Congo is potentially one of the richest countries on earth, but colonialism, slavery and corruption have turned it into one of the poorest, writes historian Dan Snow. The world\\'s bloodiest conflict since World War II is still rumbling on today. It is a war in which more than five million people have died, millions more have been driven to the brink by starvation and disease and several million women and girls have been raped. The Great War of Africa, a conflagration that has sucked in soldiers and civilians from nine nations and countless armed rebel groups, has been fought almost entirely inside the borders of one unfortunate country - the Democratic Republic of Congo.It is a place seemingly blessed with every type of mineral, yet consistently rated lowest on the UN Human Development Index, where even the more fortunate live in grinding poverty. I went to the Congo this summer to find out what it was about the country\\'s past that had delivered it into the hands of unimaginable violence and anarchy. The journey that I went on, through the Congo\\'s abusive history, while travelling across its war-torn present, was the most disturbing experience of my career. I met rape victims, rebels, bloated politicians and haunted citizens of a country that has ceased to function - people who struggle to survive in a place cursed by a past that defies description, a history that will not release them from its death-like grip. The Congo\\'s apocalyptic present is a direct product of decisions and actions taken over the past five centuries. In the late 15th Century an empire known as the Kingdom of Kongo dominated the western portion of the Congo, and bits of other modern states such as Angola. It was sophisticated, had its own aristocracy and an impressive civil service. When Portuguese traders arrived from Europe in the 1480s, they realised they had stumbled upon a land of vast natural wealth, rich in resources - particularly human flesh. The Congo was home to a seemingly inexhaustible supply of strong, disease-resistant slaves. The Portuguese quickly found this supply would be easier to tap if the interior of the continent was in a state of anarchy.They did their utmost to destroy any indigenous political force capable of curtailing their slaving or trading interests. Money and modern weapons were sent to rebels, Kongolese armies were defeated, kings were murdered, elites slaughtered and secession was encouraged. By the 1600s, the once-mighty kingdom had disintegrated into a leaderless, anarchy of mini-states locked in endemic civil war. Slaves, victims of this fighting, flowed to the coast and were carried to the Americas. About four million people were forcibly embarked at the mouth of the Congo River. English ships were at the heart of the trade. British cities and merchants grew rich on the back of Congolese resources they would never see.This first engagement with Europeans set the tone for the rest of the Congo\\'s history. Development has been stifled, government has been weak and the rule of law non-existent. This was not through any innate fault of the Congolese, but because it has been in the interests of the powerful to destroy, suppress and prevent any strong, stable, legitimate government. That would interfere - as the Kongolese had threatened to interfere before - with the easy extraction of the nation\\'s resources. The Congo has been utterly cursed by its natural wealth.The Congo is a massive country, the size of Western Europe. Limitless water, from the world\\'s second-largest river, the Congo, a benign climate and rich soil make it fertile, beneath the soil abundant deposits of copper, gold, diamonds, cobalt, uranium, coltan and oil are just some of the minerals that should make it one of the world\\'s richest countries. Instead it is the world\\'s most hopeless. The interior of the Congo was opened up in the late 19th Century by the British-born explorer Henry Morton Stanley, his dreams of free trading associations with communities he met were shattered by the infamous King of the Belgians, Leopold, who hacked out a vast private empire. The world\\'s largest supply of rubber was found at a time when bicycle and automobile tyres, and electrical insulation, had made it a vital commodity in the West. The late Victorian bicycle craze was enabled by Congolese rubber collected by slave labourers. To tap it, Congolese men were rounded up by a brutal Belgian-officered security force, their wives were interned to ensure compliance and were brutalised during their captivity. The men were then forced to go into the jungle and harvest the rubber. Disobedience or resistance was met by immediate punishment - flogging, severing of hands, and death. Millions perished. Tribal leaders capable of resisting were murdered, indigenous society decimated, proper education denied. A culture of rapacious, barbaric rule by a Belgian elite who had absolutely no interest in developing the country or population was created, and it has endured.In a move supposed to end the brutality, Belgium eventually annexed the Congo outright, but the problems in its former colony remained. Mining boomed, workers suffered in appalling conditions, producing the materials that fired industrial production in Europe and America. In World War I men on the Western Front and elsewhere did the dying, but it was Congo\\'s minerals that did the killing. The brass casings of allied shells fired at Passchendaele and the Somme were 75% Congolese copper. In World War II, the uranium for the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki came from a mine in south-east Congo. Western freedoms were defended with Congo\\'s resources while black Congolese were denied the right to vote, or form unions and political associations. They were denied anything beyond the most basic of educations. They were kept at an infantile level of development that suited the rulers and mine owners but made sure that when independence came there was no home-grown elite who could run the country. Independence in 1960 was, therefore, predictably disastrous. Bits of the vast country immediately attempted to break away, the army mutinied against its Belgian officers and within weeks the Belgian elite who ran the state evacuated leaving nobody with the skills to run the government or economy. Of 5,000 government jobs pre-independence, just three were held by Congolese and there was not a single Congolese lawyer, doctor, economist or engineer. Chaos threatened to engulf the region. The Cold War superpowers moved to prevent the other gaining the upper hand. Sucked into these rivalries, the struggling Congolese leader, Patrice Lumumba, was horrifically beaten and executed by Western-backed rebels. A military strongman, Joseph-Desire Mobutu, who had a few years before been a sergeant in the colonial police force, took over.Mobutu became a tyrant. In 1972 he changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, meaning \"the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake\".The West tolerated him as long as the minerals flowed and the Congo was kept out of the Soviet orbit. He, his family and friends bled the country of billions of dollars, a $100m palace was built in the most remote jungle at Gbadolite, an ultra-long airstrip next to it was designed to take Concorde, which was duly chartered for shopping trips to Paris.This video can not be playedDissidents were tortured or bought off, ministers stole entire budgets, government atrophied. The West allowed his regime to borrow billions, which was then stolen and today\\'s Congo is still expected to pay the bill.In 1997 an alliance of neighbouring African states, led by Rwanda - which was furious Mobutu\\'s Congo was sheltering many of those responsible for the 1994 genocide - invaded, after deciding to get rid of Mobutu. A Congolese exile, Laurent Kabila, was dredged up in East Africa to act as a figurehead. Mobutu\\'s cash-starved army imploded, its leaders, incompetent cronies of the president, abandoning their men in a mad dash to escape. Mobutu took off one last time from his jungle Versailles, his aircraft packed with valuables, his own unpaid soldiers firing at the plane as it lumbered into the air. Rwanda had effectively conquered its titanic neighbour with spectacular ease. Once installed however, Kabila, Rwanda\\'s puppet, refused to do as he was told. Again Rwanda invaded, but this time they were just halted by her erstwhile African allies who now turned on each other and plunged Congo into a terrible war. Foreign armies clashed deep inside the Congo as the paper-thin state collapsed totally and anarchy spread. Hundreds of armed groups carried out atrocities, millions died. Ethnic and linguistic differences fanned the ferocity of the violence, while control of Congo\\'s stunning natural wealth added a terrible urgency to the fighting. Forcibly conscripted child soldiers corralled armies of slaves to dig for minerals such as coltan, a key component in mobile phones, the latest obsession in the developed world, while annihilating enemy communities, raping women and driving survivors into the jungle to die of starvation and disease. A deeply flawed, partial peace was patched together a decade ago. In the far east of the Congo, there is once again a shooting war as a complex web of domestic and international rivalries see rebel groups clash with the army and the UN, while tiny community militias add to the general instability. The country has collapsed, roads no longer link the main cities, healthcare depends on aid and charity. The new regime is as grasping as its predecessors. I rode on one of the trainloads of copper that go straight from foreign-owned mines to the border, and on to the Far East, rumbling past shanty towns of displaced, poverty-stricken Congolese. The Portuguese, Belgians, Mobutu and the present government have all deliberately stifled the development of a strong state, army, judiciary and education system, because it interferes with their primary focus, making money from what lies under the Earth. The billions of pounds those minerals have generated have brought nothing but misery and death to the very people who live on top of them, while enriching a microscopic elite in the Congo and their foreign backers, and underpinning our technological revolution in the developed world. The Congo is a land far away, yet our histories are so closely linked. We have thrived from a lopsided relationship, yet we are utterly blind to it. The price of that myopia has been human suffering on an unimaginable scale. Dan Snow answered readers\\' questions on Twitter using #AskDanSnow. Here is a selection.Q: Did you ever feel in real danger?A: Shots were fired when we were on the frontline, but the biggest threat was terrible roads and bad vehiclesQ: Why go back to 1500s and ignore the devastating role of revolutionary movements in destabilizing Congo the last 50 years?A: We tried to do both. The problems of the recent past are children of the more distant history.Q: Why haven\\'t western nations shown greater interest in stabilising DRC considering its mineral wealth?A: Sadly I think leaders think it\\'s a massive, insoluble problem that they don\\'t understand in a far away land.Q: How do you see these countries getting out of this situation? A: Rwanda succeeded in massive reduction in poverty, and development of infrastructure. It requires totally different leadership.Q: I visited DRC in 2012. Why are people so unaware of the negative impact of Western Europeans (and now China too)?A: It is a blind spot for us. I just don\\'t know why. Perhaps we don\\'t like to dwell on our failures.Q: What advice do you have for businesses intending to invest in the country?A: Have impeccable local political contacts, or don\\'t even try.Q: Do you think the war in Congo is the obstacle to the country\\'s poor utilization of it natural resources?A: Warlords control access to the resources and the bigger, more responsible mining firms will not risk the investment.Q: Is poverty in such a rich nation caused by greedy Congolese leaders or post-colonial powers?A: Nationality of the rulers hasn\\'t mattered much, they\\'ve all behaved the same. The potential wealth has corrupted all of them.Q: How difficult was it to travel through the Democratic Republic of Congo?A: Exceptionally. Roads collapsed, bandits own the night, no road travel between the major cities.Q: How can we help the Congolese people to benefit from their own natural resources?A: We can pressure international players in the resources extraction industry to be more transparent.Q: If you could pick just one thing to change in Congo, what would it be?A: The rule of law. People need protection when rights are violated, to start businesses and to find out where the money goes.And finally. The Um Bongo thing. Everybody asks. Mbongo in a local language means money.

He\\xa0has been in custody since April 8 and will go on trial on Monday with two other defendants, a Lebanese businessman and another presidential official.The 61-year-old, who made a pact to back Tshisekedi in a 2018 election on the expectation of succeeding him in 2023, denies any wrongdoing.Once a pillar of the government of former President Joseph Kabila, Kamerhe is the leader of the influential Union for the Congolese Nation. He previously served as parliamentary speaker and\\xa0has\\xa0been at the very heart of the DRC’s political life for some 20 years.His supporters charge that the case is politically motivated, a possible attempt to prevent him from running in the next presidential election. Kamerhe’s arrest last month was met with protests in his hometown of Bukavu in the eastern DRC, when some 300 supporters burned tyres and blocked the road outside his party headquarters.“Never in Congo’s political history over the past two decades has such an important player on the political scene been put behind bars,” New York University’s Congo Research Group (CRG) said in an analysis.',\n",

The trial is expected to begin later this month. Congo’s death penalty has not been carried out in two decades, but Muhani could still get a life sentence.The showdown between the Denise Nyakeru Tshisekedi Foundation, founded by First Lady Denise Nyakeru Tshisekedi, and Congolese activists began in June, when Lucha alleged that local authorities in North Kivu’s Rutshuru territory and some of the foundation’s staff had misappropriated goods intended for people displaced by the Nyiragongo volcanic\\xa0eruption. While an official from Rutshuru and his associate were prosecuted and convicted, the foundation was not investigated.Instead, the foundation filed a complaint against Lucha members, and the authorities arrested Muhani in Goma on July 6. On August 22, the authorities arrested another Lucha activist, Ghislain Muhiwa, 31, during his wedding celebrations. And an arrest warrant has been issued against a third Lucha member, Espoir Ngalukiye.“We thought that the judiciary was [also] going to investigate those responsible [at the foundation] for the [alleged] misappropriations,” Muhiwa told us. “But it turned out differently.”Because martial law is currently in force in North Kivu, Muhani and Muhiwa will be tried before a military court, contrary to the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which says civilians should never face military trial.Muhani and Muhiwa were previously targeted for their activism. Both were detained for months in 2016 and 2018 at Goma’s prison for peacefully protesting then-President Joseph Kabila’s staying in office beyond the two-term limit.Over the past year, Human Rights Watch has documented dozens of cases involving state agents and security forces targeting activists critical of the government, including other Lucha members and whistleblowers.Prosecutors in Congo should stop responding to allegations of corruption by prosecuting those making the claims. Rather than targeting the messengers, the authorities should investigate Lucha’s allegations into misappropriation of aid and take appropriate action.Access to Services for Survivors of Gender-Based Violence in Ethiopia’s Tigray RegionViolence Against Women and Girls During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Kenya',\n",

Join our movement today.Human Rights Watch  is a 501(C)(3)\\xa0nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 13-2875808Discover Thomson ReutersBy Stanis Bujakera, Hereward Holland3 Min ReadKINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo’s deputy health minister has accused cabinet members of receiving kickbacks on government contracts for the coronavirus response while health workers went unpaid for months.Albert M’peti Biyombo told Reuters on Wednesday that a confidential letter from him to the prime minister dated June 29, which was widely shared on social media, was authentic, adding: “I don’t know how it got out.”The letter accused unnamed members of the cabinet of colluding with networks within the health ministry to embezzle funds from the government and its aid partners even as state hospitals lacked drugs and basic equipment.The allegations are likely to worsen a standoff over pay with those responding to the coronavirus epidemic in Democratic Republic of Congo. Last week, health workers in the capital Kinshasa began a partial strike in protest at not being paid bonuses for months.“These mafia networks require kickbacks of up to 35% from structures benefiting from these funds,” Biyombo said in the letter, where he recalled a previous request for a financial audit of the response.He said that Health Minister Eteni Longondo had signed off large disbursements of funds - for ambulances, beds and other medical equipment - without seeking his deputy’s counter-signature, overriding government procurement rules.Longondo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“I am regularly under pressure to sign non-priority and unrelated financial documents,” Biyongo said. He pointed to examples including the payment of medical fees for coronavirus treatment at a hospital not designated for free care by the government.Since confirming its first case of coronavirus in March, Congo has recorded over 7,700 cases, overwhelmingly in Kinshasa. But health authorities say a shortage of test kits and widespread stigmatisation around testing mean the true number of infections is likely to be far higher.In March, Longondo’s predecessor Oly Ilunga was sentenced to five years of forced labour for embezzling more than $400,000 from Ebola response funds.Writing by Hereward Holland; Editing by Alessandra Prentice and Kevin LiffeyOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Cattle-rearing groups rub up against crop-growers over access to land. In the absence of a strong state, disputes can quickly turn violent. By contrast another type of nomadism obsesses the population in Gombe, the wealthy core of Congo’s capital, Kinshasa: that of elected officials.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Few politicians are loyal to ideas or people. Instead they head for the best grazing. “The Congolese politician is the most unstable human ever to exist,” says Félix Momat Kitenge, until recently a government minister. “He will change with the breeze.” Others call it, in French, transhumance politique (political nomadism).On January 27th several hundred members of Congo’s parliament put on their metaphorical walking boots and took a hike. They left the majority political grouping, the Front Commun pour le Congo (FCC), which is affiliated with Joseph Kabila, Congo’s president until 2019. Most joined two of the largest opposition parties in supporting a new majority called the “Sacred Union” set up by Félix Tshisekedi, who has been president for the past two years. The prime minister, Sylvestre Ilunga Ilukamba, an ally of Mr Kabila’s, resigned. So did his ministers, including Mr Momat. A new government will now be appointed that will be closer to Mr Tshisekedi.Mr Tshisekedi’s ascent to the presidency, in rigged elections at the end of 2018, was unexpected. For much of his adult life he had lived in Belgium. He was given a place on the ballot largely because of the reputation of his late father, Étienne, a firebrand opposition leader who died in 2017. Electoral tallies compiled by the Catholic church suggested that Mr Tshisekedi came second, with under 20% of the vote, well behind Martin Fayulu, a charismatic anti-corruption campaigner. Yet Mr Tshisekedi, to the astonishment of many Congolese, was declared the winner, seemingly as part of a last-minute deal with the former president. The quid pro quo, allegedly, was that Mr Kabila kept control of much of the state.Yet power has steadily flowed to Mr Tshisekedi as he has appointed allies to key posts. He appears to have routed Mr Kabila more quickly and comprehensively than almost anyone predicted. “We thought it would be closer to 50/50,” says Manya Riche, a Congolese political analyst. “This totally surpassed that.”Exactly how Mr Tshisekedi achieved this is unclear. Supporters of Mr Kabila (or at least those who did not swap sides) mutter that bribery must have been involved. There are whispers that some MPs took payouts of $7,000-15,000 to join the new coalition. One leading MP who changed sides admits that although “money circulated”, people were offered much more to stay. Other MPs may simply have been unnerved enough to change their allegiance by Mr Tshisekedi’s threat to call new elections. He has also targeted allies of Mr Kabila with an anti-corruption drive. Faced with the chance of lucrative positions under Mr Tshisekedi on the one hand, and prosecution on the other, many opted to migrate to the president’s greener pastures.Mr Tshisekedi made big promises on coming to office, including providing free primary schooling, building infrastructure and reforming the electoral system. Almost none of that has happened. Most Congolese remain extremely poor. In a park near the parliament, a group of men playing backgammon with bottle tops say that jobs remain scarce. “The poor in Congo still suffer, while the rich continue to eat,” complains Eric Kayado, a petrol vendor. (“Eat”, in Congo, implies “embezzle”.)Mr Tshisekedi has long argued that Mr Kabila’s control of parliament was a problem. “The system of Mr Kabila was to block [progress],” says Jacquemain Shabani, an official in Mr Tshisekedi’s party, the UDPS. Outside the party’s offices, a crowd of his supporters argue that their president has “chased away” Mr Kabila and will now bring them the changes they hope for. “Now he can work for the people,” says Darcin Mukendi.Yet a new majority may not make reform easier. The new government will not necessarily be stable, notes Ms Riche. The president’s new allies will be competing for ministerial positions. Not every aisle-crosser will stay loyal. The economy remains weak and, for the moment, Mr Kabila retains his grip on a large part of it.Some fear that Mr Tshisekedi may end up emulating Mr Kabila, whose final years in office were characterised by grotesque corruption and the suppression of dissent. On coming to office Mr Tshisekedi released political prisoners and promised freedom of the press. Now he appears to be backtracking. On January 28th Human Rights Watch, a watchdog, accused Mr Tshisekedi’s government of having arbitrarily detained and prosecuted journalists and activists. It is too early to conclude that the new boss is the same as the old boss. But ordinary Congolese have cause to worry. ■This article appeared in the Middle East & Africa section of the print edition under the headline \"The president pounces\"A daily newsletter with the best of our journalismThe digital revolution will be grounded in fibre, steel and concreteThe podium celebration will be under heavy scrutinyChina’s lending is slowing, even as the West is promising moreThe digital revolution will be grounded in fibre, steel and concreteThe podium celebration will be under heavy scrutinyChina’s lending is slowing, even as the West is promising moreThe unrest is a reminder of what the country could gain from a dealSouth Africans feel unjustly punished for their country’s scientific rigourPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” Copyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2021.

(Image: Saint Nic Media / Corruption Watch) With an average score of 32, Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest performing region on the CPI, showing little improvement from previous years and underscoring a need for urgent action.  With a score of 66, the Seychelles consistently earns top marks in the region, followed by Botswana (60) and Cabo Verde (58). At the bottom of the index are Sudan (16), Somalia (12) and South Sudan (12). Across the region, the COVID-19 pandemic highlights structural gaps in national health care systems, corruption risks associated with public procurement and the misappropriation of emergency funds. The economic shock of the pandemic led to protests and dissent in many countries, including South Africa (44), Angola (27) and Zimbabwe (24), about rising costs of living, corruption and the widespread misuse of emergency funds. In South Africa, an audit of COVID-19 expenditures revealed overpricing, fraud and corruption. In Nigeria (25), civil society organisations denounced reports of hoarding of COVID-19 medications by states and called on anti-corruption institutions to investigate the allegations.  More generally, bribery continues to impede access to basic services. In 2019, the Global Corruption Barometer – Africa revealed that more than one out of four people – or approximately 130 million citizens in the 35 African countries surveyed – paid a bribe to access essential public services, like health care. Unless these corruption challenges are addressed, many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa risk missing their Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets come 2030. The region is already experiencing an alarming rise in extreme poverty, undermining the progress of recent decades. Institutions charged with providing basic public services should be more transparent and accountable in their operations. Improved policies and mechanisms are needed to allow citizens to access public information, demand accountability and safely report corruption. Scoring 36 on the CPI, Côte d’Ivoire has significantly improved, by nine points since 2013. However, the political crisis surrounding the re-election of President Allasane Ouattara, which erupted into violence and human rights violations, risks derailing progress. With a score of 19, the Republic of Congo significantly declined by seven points since 2012. This performance is reflective of endemic corruption and impunity by the country’s political elite. The Republic of Congo has an anti-corruption framework in place, but its implementation remains weak. To reverse the region’s position as the worst performing on the CPI, governments in Sub-Saharan Africa must take decisive action, particularly in those economies already weakened by the ongoing economic recession stemming from COVID-19. Rather than add pledges, countries must enforce numerous existing anti-corruption commitments, including Agenda 2063, the transformative agenda of the African Union for inclusive growth and sustainable development. These commitments can only be successfully realised if the continent is rooted in good governance, democratic values, gender equality, respect for human rights, justice and the rule of law. With a score of 30, Malawi is a significant decliner on the CPI, dropping seven points since 2012. Notorious for the “cash-gate scandal” of 2013, involving high levels of public sector corruption and misappropriation of funds, the country continues to grapple with corruption. A recent government audit revealed public sector corruption of astronomical proportions, with an estimated US$1 billion allegedly stolen by the previous government.A new government elected in June 2020 promises a fresh start, with several investigations into corruption already underway, and some key arrests made in connection with a cement import scandal. In addition, the extradition of a high-profile Malawian pastor accused of money laundering in South Africa may be another test of the country’s commitment to anti-corruption. Malawi has an opportunity to strengthen good governance and promote anti-corruption efforts to reverse the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. (Image: CC BY-SA 3.0 / MsTingak)With a score of 33, Zambia is a significant decliner on the CPI, dropping five points since 2013. Corruption is endemic in Zambia and affects people’s access to essential public services. According to our 2019 report, nearly one in five Zambian citizens paid bribes to receive services like health care or education. The mounting levels of corruption may be attributable to weaknesses in the national public procurement system, operating against a backdrop of rising foreign debt and high levels of poverty. Stronger commitment to procurement reforms and open civic spaces will support greater transparency and accountability, but the upcoming general election will ultimately determine whether corruption will be a priority in the coming years. In Zambia, commitment to procurement reforms will support greater transparency and accountability.

Kinshasa’s Delegate Says ‘State of Siege’ Will Be Lifted When Conditions Improve Noting the ongoing security challenges in several provinces, the Secretary-General’s Special Representative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo today called on the Security Council to continue providing its “full backing” to the United Nations peacekeeping mission in that country.Bintou Keita, who also heads the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), briefed the 15‑member Council on the contents of the Secretary‑General’s latest report on the situation.  She was joined by Abdou Abarry (Niger), Chair of Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who reported on the sanctions regime’s recent activities.Outlining some elements of a proposed MONUSCO transition plan — which lays out benchmarks for the Mission’s drawdown and eventual exit — Ms. Keita said the plan was jointly developed by the United Nations and the Congolese authorities.  Describing it as a “roadmap that can help guide the work of the Mission in the coming years and prepare the ground for its orderly and responsible withdrawal”, she nevertheless cautioned that the plan must not obscure the work that remains to silence the guns in the east, foster the political dialogue necessary to pave the way for credible and transparent elections in 2023 and support the long‑term strengthening of the country’s institutions.  Therefore, MONUSCO still needs the Council’s full support, including its endorsement of the transition plan with adequate financial resources.Nelly Godelieve Madieka Mbangu, Coordinator of the civil society group Sauti y’a Mama Mukongomani/Voice of Congolese Women, remarked that the state of siege recently declared by President Félix Tshisekedi in North Kivu and Ituri provinces allowed MONUSCO and the State armed forces to defeat militant groups and restore State authority in some areas.  The goal, however, is to eradicate all armed groups.  She urged the Council to help strengthen MONUSCO’s rapid reaction units to meet the security needs in the east, and to support the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.  The Council can also help restore State authority and set up an international investigative mechanism for crimes of genocide committed in the country, she said, also drawing attention to the dynamic work of Congolese women and highlighting the importance of their participation in the peace process.In the ensuing discussion, Kenya’s representative, speaking also for Niger, Tunisia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, said the transition plan must be implemented following a clear evaluation and assessment of the benchmarks achieved.  Those should include an efficient transfer of important tasks, such as early warning networks, to the host Government, and enhanced peacebuilding efforts focused on socioeconomic development towards post‑conflict reconstruction.France’s delegate emphasized that a “partnership logic must prevail”, with the Mission continuing its stabilization efforts and protecting civilians.  Noting that an improved security situation in Tanganyika province will permit MONUSCO’s withdrawal from the area in 2022, he called for a credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful process to that end.The representative of the United Kingdom stressed that the Government bears the responsibility for creating long‑term conditions for peace and for the Mission’s withdrawal.  Minimum benchmarks must be met, while MONUSCO hands over tasks to the United Nations country team and the Government against clear timelines.The Russian Federation’s delegate, noting that the national armed forces and MONUSCO have yet to curb numerous illegal militant groups, said that Moscow will carefully study the Mission’s proposed transition plan.Several speakers condemned allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by United Nations personnel in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the representative of the United States demanding greater accountability for “such predatory behaviour” and assistance to victims.The representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reiterated his request to the Council to lift restrictions on the import of military supplies and enable the State to enhance its capacity to combat armed groups.  Among other things, he also called for severe and exemplary punishment against criminal groups or multinationals who support armed groups through the illegal exploitation of minerals.Also speaking today were the representatives of Ireland, India, Norway, Mexico, China, Viet Nam and Estonia.The meeting began at 10:04 a.m. and ended at 11:53 a.m.BriefingsBINTOU KEITA, Special Representative of the Secretary‑General and Head of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), briefed the Council and presented the Secretary‑General’s latest report on the situation (document S/2021/807).  She said the primary — and undoubtedly, the biggest — challenge in the country is the security and protection of civilians in the east.  Since the declaration of a state of siege by the Government in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, MONUSCO has redoubled its efforts to support the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), the police and the judicial authorities, in order to restore State presence and authority in each of those provinces.  The Armed Forces’ intelligence‑gathering capabilities have been enhanced, and MONUSCO is providing training on military tactics and respect for the principles of human rights and humanitarian law.  The state of siege made it possible to strengthen the partnership between MONUSCO and the FARDC.  Meanwhile, all rapid reaction units are on track to be deployed by the end of October to strengthen civilian protection capacity during joint operations against armed groups.Although joint military operations resulted in the dismantling of several of the armed groups’ strongholds, she went on to state that human rights violations perpetrated by both State- and non‑State actors — particularly in the provinces of Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu — remain worrying.  Between June and August, 367 people were victims of arbitrary and extrajudicial executions, with 203 people, mostly women and children, suffering sexual violence.  The United Nations adhered to a zero‑tolerance policy for sexual exploitation and abuse and provides comprehensive assistance to victims.  Following recent allegations regarding the Ebola response, the humanitarian team in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has strengthened its systems to prevent and combat sexual exploitation and abuse, with $1.5 billion available through a common humanitarian fund.On the country’s democratic consolidation, she said that while the formation of a new Government in April provided an opportunity to advance critical reforms, the focus of political actors and civil society is shifting towards the 2023 elections.  There is still no consensus on the composition of the Independent National Electoral Commission and several members of the opposition have organized rallies to contest that body’s reform, which has already been adopted by Parliament.  Reiterating the need for an inclusive and peaceful electoral process founded on dialogue, trust and transparency, she said MONUSCO continues to pursue its good offices with actors across the political spectrum, including to advocate for increased women’s participation in the process.Beyond these challenges, she said the implementation of the MONUSCO transition plan — which was submitted to the Council in the Annex to the Secretary‑General’s report — represents a real opportunity for both the Government and the United Nations.  Operationalizing the plan, which is closely linked to the Government’s programme of action, will hinge largely on the authorities’ ability to finance their priorities and create the conditions necessary for the withdrawal of the Mission.  The Government’s 2022 budget bill emphasizing security, education, health and the acceleration of economic growth is a step in the right direction.  With view to MONUSCO’s withdrawal from Tanganyika province in June 2022, the Mission is working closely across the United Nations system to ensure the necessary support, consolidate gains and tackle the last pockets of insecurity, while incorporating lessons learned from the Mission’s withdrawal from Kasaï.Highlighting President Félix Tshisekedi’s ongoing efforts to improve the political climate in the Great Lakes region, she said the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s term at the helm of the African Union offers an opportunity to not only foster peace, stability and development, but also to consolidate the partnership between the continental body and the United Nations.  On the renewal of MONUSCO’s mandate, she noted that the joint transition plan “constitutes a roadmap that can help guide the work of the Mission in the coming years and prepare the ground for its orderly and responsible withdrawal”.  However, that must not obscure the fact that there is still much to do to silence the guns in the eastern provinces, foster the political dialogue necessary to pave the way for credible and transparent elections in 2023 and support the long‑term strengthening of the country’s institutions.  She went on to call on the Council to continue providing its full backing to MONUSCO, including by endorsing the joint transition plan with adequate financial resources and playing an active role in its operationalization.ABDOU ABARRY (Niger), briefing the Council in his capacity as Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, outlined the body’s activities since his last presentation in October 2020.  The Committee has held three in‑person meetings, in addition to four sessions held via videoconference due to the COVID‑19 pandemic.  On 3 December 2020, the Committee heard a midterm report by the coordinator of the Group of Experts and discussed its conclusions and recommendations.  On 22 January 2021, following informal consultations with the coordinator of the Group of Experts, several regional States shared their comments and observations.  He added that the Committee also heard briefings by a range of experts during the reporting period, including speakers from the United Nations Mine Action Service and the head of MONUSCO’s working group on the arms embargo.He said that, in the course of consultations held via videoconference on 20 May, the Committee heard a presentation of the final report by a coordinator of the Group of Experts, and examined its conclusions and recommendations.  During the same meeting, the Committee heard a report by the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba, on the situation of children in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  On 9 July, the Committee held its first in‑person meeting since the start of the pandemic, to discuss the final report and to hear comments and observations from representatives of regional States.  On the theme of resources, he said on 30 July, a meeting was held on the illicit trade in gold, tantalum and tungsten in the national and international market, with members hearing from a number of experts on that subject.He went on to note that the Committee continues to support the mechanism investigating of the murder of two former experts of the Committee, Zaida Catalán and Michael Sharp, which took place in 2017.  Several proposals were submitted by the Group of Experts to update the sanctions list on 10 August 2020, in line with Council resolution 2478 (2019).  The Committee accepted updates concerning two persons and three entities and is awaiting updates and responses from concerned Member States in that regard.  With additional information, on 2 November, the Committee accepted an update concerning an entry to the list.  He concluded by noting that a delegation of the Committee will be conducting a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo between 5 and 10 November, to gain firsthand information on the effective impact of sanctions.  The visit will also offer an opportunity to hold consultations with the Government and with representatives of MONUSCO and civil society, with the aim of ensuring the full implementation of measures set out in paragraph 30 of resolution 2360 (2017).NELLY GODELIEVE MADIEKA MBANGU, Coordinator of the civil society group Sauti y’a Mama Mukongomani/Voice of Congolese Women, said the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been the epicentre of armed conflict for decades, with women and children severely impacted.  In response, the Security Council dispatched a peacekeeping mission to the country, now the largest mission in Africa and more than 20 years old.  Despite its deployment, however, the east is still facing the same challenges, including mass displacement, rapes and sexual violence.  Noting that the perpetrators of such crimes include both State- and non‑State actors, she added that natural resources have been looted, villages have been burned and children cannot go to school.Welcoming the declared state of siege, she said some armed groups have been disbanded and State authority has been re-established in some parts of the country.  The goal is to eradicate all armed groups, she said, urging the Council to help strengthen rapid reaction units to meet the security needs in the east of the country, and to support the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.  The Council can also help restore State authority and set up an international investigative mechanism for crimes of genocide committed in the country.  Drawing attention to the dynamic work of women in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, she stressed the importance of women’s participation in the peace process and asked the Council to strengthen its support for women’s organizations.StatementsNICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) welcomed progress made in improving the security situation in recent months and expressed support for the adoption of the order on disarmament, demobilization, community reintegration and stabilization.  He also praised efforts to combat impunity and called for their continuation, and for the model of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission established in Kasaï to be expanded to other regions.  The role of women in public positions must be further strengthened, he added, while calling for better coordination between the national armed forces and MONUSCO in the country’s east and for continued action to combat and prevent the use of improvised explosive devices.  The reconfiguration of the Force Intervention Brigade ought to help improve the response to asymmetric threats, notably that of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).  On the MONUSCO transition plan, he emphasized that a “partnership logic must prevail”, with the Mission continuing its stabilization efforts and protecting civilians.  Noting that an improved security situation in Tanganyika will permit MONUSCO’s withdrawal in 2022, he called for a credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful process to that end.GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said the upcoming 2023 elections will be an important time for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and expressed regret over the increase in tensions related to the Independent Election Commission.  In that context, reform process questions must be resolved in a transparent manner.  Noting that the state of siege has been extended multiple times, she said it is impacting timely access to justice, extending pre-trial detentions and contributing to prison overcrowding.  Expressing concern over reports of pervasive sexual based violence, including by State actors, she said it is essential that humanitarian and democratic space is respected.  Nevertheless, progress continues to be made on the Women, Peace and Security agenda, with positive indications around the meaningful participation of women in political processes.  Turning to MONUSCO’s transition plan, she said its 18 identified benchmarks are comprehensive and should provide a clear and predictable roadmap for Mission’s phased withdrawal.  It is crucial, however, that there is sufficient flexibility in the Plan to allow for setbacks and unexpected challenges, and timelines and benchmarks must be closely monitored and adjusted as necessary.JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom) expressed concern about the deteriorating security and humanitarian situations, as well as rising casualties due to armed violence, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Welcoming improved operational cooperation among the relevant security stakeholders, he nevertheless voiced concern about increasing cases of former combatants being rearmed and called for the timely development of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration strategy and its implementation.  On plans for MONUSCO’s drawdown, he welcomed the transition strategy and its identified benchmarks, stressing that the Government bears the responsibility to create long-term conditions for peace and for the Mission’s withdrawal.  Minimum benchmarks must be met for a drawdown, while the MONUSCO hands over tasks to the United Nations country team and the Government against clear timelines.  He also called for enhanced coordination with the World Bank, humanitarian agencies and civil society.ANNA M. EVSTIGNEEVA (Russian Federation) said that unfortunately, the Congolese armed forces and MONUSCO peacekeepers have so far failed to curb the activities of numerous illegal armed formations, especially the ADF armed group.  Noting that her delegation will carefully study the the MONUSCO transition plan prepared by the United Nations in coordination with the Congolese authorities, she said that, in principle, it is not possible to achieve long‑term normalization solely by military means.  Work should continue to fully implement the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework agreement, she said, pointing to security cooperation in the eastern parts of the country and across the region.  The Russian Federation is a member of the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes Region and intends to actively contribute to the peace process in the country and the region.RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India) expressed hope that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and opposition parties will maintain the current positive trajectory in the run-up to the 2023 elections.  On the security front, he underscored that the primary responsibility to protect civilians lies with the Government and recalled the assertion made by President Felix Tshisekedi in his recent General Assembly address on the presence of terrorists operating under the cover in Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu and Maniema.  Welcoming the creation of a Programme for Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration and Community Stabilization, he said MONUSCO’s role is to support the Armed Forces in addressing the threat of armed groups.  Turning to MONUSCO’s transition and exit, he said the continued implementation of the security strategy at the national and provincial levels, as well as a plan of action for security sector reform, will be crucial.MONA JUUL (Norway) observed that tensions have increased between political and civil society actors regarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s electoral reforms and called on the Congolese authorities to ensure an inclusive and transparent processes in the build‑up to the 2023 elections.  Despite five months of a state of siege in Ituri and North Kivu by the Government, the security situation in the east of the country is deteriorating, she warned.  The threat posed by armed groups against civilians is particularly concerning, as is the continued high number of human rights violations and abuses — including instances of sexual and gender‑based violence.  As for MONUSCO’s transition plan, its success hinges on constructive, effective cooperation and dialogue between a range of stakeholders, including the Congolese authorities and different parts of the United Nations system, she said.LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) expressed deep concern about the continuing violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s eastern provinces, where armed groups such as “ISIS-DRC, also known as ADF” perpetrate violence daily.  In the current state of siege, better coordination with local authorities is required for MONUSCO to fulfil its robust mandate.  She welcomed MONUSCO’s exit from Kasaï province earlier in 2021 and commended the transitional justice that paved the way for a smooth drawdown, while expressing hoped for a similar withdrawal from Tanganyika in 2022.  Turning to the Joint Transition Plan, she hoped its benchmarks will be attainable.  The promotion of key governance and security sector reforms are important, with elections approaching in 2023, and the dire continuing violence in the east, she stressed.  She went on to condemn the “horrifying and unacceptable” allegations of abuse by United Nations staff — 17 of which were raised in 2021 — noting that while many implicated troops and police, a significant portion concerned civilian staff.  Such predatory behaviour must end across the United Nations system, she said, demanding greater accountability and assistance for those harmed.JUAN GÓMEZ ROBLEDO VERDUZCO (Mexico) commended progress made by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and MONUSCO in recent months, as well as the adoption of resolution 2556 (2020) which aimed to reduce the presence of MONUSCO.  However, he expressed concern over the continuing violence in Ituri and North and South Kivu in recent months, which have seen attacks by armed groups such as the Cooperative for Development of the Congo and ADF.  He called upon all actors to comply with international human rights law, and for greater efforts to fight hate speech, which increases intercommunity violence and displacement.  He went on to commend MONUSCO’s efforts through the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo and its consequent effects.DAI BING (China) welcomed the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s three‑year programme of action, stressing the importance of focusing on governance and electoral reform, which are key to national unity.  Noting the ongoing efforts toward regional security and cooperation, he urged the country and its neighbours in the Great Lakes region to continue improving relations.  Security must be addressed in a comprehensive manger, he said, welcoming President Tshisekedi’s determination — shown in his recent address to the General Assembly — to combat armed groups.  Citing the joint transition plan for MONUSCO’s drawdown and 18 benchmarks, he said that in the areas where MONUSCO has withdrawn, United Nations country teams must take follow‑up actions.  He also urged international financial institutions to increase aid to the country, while calling on the Council to heed the concerns expressed by the Congolese authorities and ensure that such sanctions do not undermine the country’s capacity‑building efforts.DINH QUY DANG (Viet Nam) noted the ongoing tensions among political and civil society actors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and underlined the critical importance of integrating women’s voice in the political process. Expressing concern over the continued deterioration of the security situation in the east of the country — especially in Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu — he strongly condemned attacks against civilians, peacekeepers and humanitarian operations.  Also citing the impacts of socioeconomic hardship, displacement and COVID‑19, he stressed the utmost importance of addressing the root causes of instability.  In that regard, he welcomed the Government’s establishment and implementation of the Disarmament, Demobilization, Community Recovery and Stabilization Programme, which maps out a comprehensive strategy to combat hostile armed groups, and commended efforts to formulate a transition plan for the progressive and phased drawdown of MONUSCO.SVEN JÜRGENSON (Estonia) welcomed the maintenance of stability by the Government, as well as progress made on relations with neighboring countries. While taking note of the Government’s commitment to facilitating reforms ahead of the 2023 elections and to furthering the equitable representation of women, he underscored the importance of efforts to tackle hate speech and incitement to violence.  On the security situation, he expressed concern about the unabated “circle of violence” in Kivu and Ituri provinces, and incidents in conflict-affected areas involving armed groups and State agents, which have resulted in the killing of at least 600 civilians.  Such violence has exacerbated the humanitarian situation, he said, noting that the country ranked high in the number of internally displaced persons in Africa.  He welcomed efforts to establish a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, and called for an end to impunity and support for justice and the rule of law.MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), Council President for October, spoke in his national capacity and also on behalf of Niger, Tunisia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, commending the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the progress made in diminishing armed group activities, particularly through the declaration of the state of siege in conflict‑affected eastern provinces.  The joint offensive operations carried out by the national armed forces and MONUSCO in combatting those armed groups should be intensified.  Welcoming the establishment of a disarmament, demobilization, community reintegration and stabilization programme by the Government under its programme of action for 2021‑2023, he also acknowledged the establishment of a Contact and Coordination Group by neighbouring States and the adoption of a two‑year action plan by heads of intelligence and security services of the regional States mandated to oversee non‑military approaches towards the eradication of negative forces in the Great Lakes region.He went on to commend the efforts made by the Government, with the support of MONUSCO, to improve and strengthen its weapons and ammunitions management systems, urging the Security Council to give due consideration to the request for the removal of the notification requirement for the Government to acquire weapons.  Noting the joint transition plan for MONUSCO, he said it must be implemented following a clear evaluation and assessment of the benchmarks achieved.  Those should include an efficient transfer of important tasks, such as early warning networks, to the host Government and enhanced peacebuilding efforts focused on socioeconomic development initiatives that promote post‑conflict reconstruction.  Spotlighting the principle of subsidiarity as enshrined in the United Nations Charter, he recognized the significant role of regional organizations, namely the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region and the African Union, in supporting mediation, dialogue and promoting sustainable peace, security and development.PAUL LOSOKO EFAMBE EMPOLE (Democratic Republic of the Congo) described significant challenges faced in his country’s eastern provinces, with holdout armed groups wreaking terror and destruction.  Greater domestic, international and bilateral efforts, as well as military and non‑military solutions, are required to address them, he said, recalling that President Tshisekedi recently declared a state of siege in two provinces in order to stamp out those negative forces.  The strengthened military presence has been bolstered by joint military operations with MONUSCO, he said, adding that the siege will be lifted once the circumstances that led to its imposition are reversed.  He went on to outline measures taken to normalize peace, security and economic cooperation with neighboring countries, including the signing of protocol agreements to tackle terrorism and foster cross‑border trade with Uganda, cooperation agreements to tackle tax evasion with Rwanda and a railway line connecting Kindu in the Democratic Republic of Congo with Gitega in Burundi.Noting that the state of siege led to voluntary weapon surrenders by various warlords and armed groups, he said the President signed two recent ordinances establishing a Disarmament, Demobilization, Community Recovery and Stabilization Programme and appointed its members.  The implementation of such operations pose significant security and financial challenges, for which the support of donors and other partners is crucial.  Turning to the political situation, he said efforts are under way to hold elections in 2023, including through the reform of a law to strengthen the operations of the Independent National Election Commission, as well as continued support to transitional justice mechanisms and the establishment of an anti‑corruption agency.  He recalled his request to the sanctions committee to lift prenotification measures for the import of military supplies and called for severe and exemplary punishment against criminal groups or multinationals who support armed groups through the illegal exploitation of minerals.',\n",

The sanctions were dropped by Donald Trump before being reimposed again earlier this year by the Biden administration.Cobalt supply chain expert Elisabeth Claesens, director of non-profit group Resource Matters said: “Britishvolt CEO’s claim that Glencore’s cobalt is ‘ethical’ shows that their due diligence process is likely either too narrow or too shallow.“Glencore transfers more than 2% of its Congo cobalt proceeds to Dan Gertler’s network, which is under sanction for corruption.“Glencore’s mining deals are under investigation in at least three western jurisdictions for potential financial misconduct.“Car makers should ask Britishvolt how its supplier – and now shareholder – mitigates this corruption risk.”A Glencore spokesperson said it couldn’t comment on the investigations.“Glencore is committed to operating ethically and responsibly in all aspects of its business,” they said.The United States on Wednesday, January 23, 2019, recognized Felix Tshisekedi (pictured) as the next president of DR Congo, casting aside concerns over the election as it hailed a historic peaceful transfer of power. PHOTO | JOHN WESSELS | AFPKinshasaCorruption is Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi’s latest headache following his takeover from Joseph Kabila in January last year.Last week, the President authorised the\\xa0 General Inspectorate of Finance to track down “mafia networks’ involved in the theft of public money.The Democratic Republic of Congo has been fighting Ebola and Covid-19 crises and Mr Tshisekedi says he is now dealing with “disappearing public funds”.Some economists have cited the Covid-19 pandemic in explaining the financial crisis but DR Congo has perennially been one of the most corrupt countries in Africa.The 2019 Transparency Corruption Index, for example, puts the country at position 168 out of the 198 polled across the world.HUGE BUDGETPresident Tshisekedi recently told his Council of Ministers that a number of senior officials in his government have been targeting public coffers.Last year, his national budget was $11 billion, more than double what his predecessor’s budget was in 2018 - $5.9 billion.With a 63.2 per cent rise in budgetary allocations, the President’s idea has been to put more money into infrastructure that had stalled or never existed, but corruption targeted the very money.Some of the money was to fund a project meant to improve certain amenities in the first 100 days.But then Chief of Staff Vital Kamerhe was charged with theft of $50 million meant for the project. In June, Mr Kamerhe was jailed for 20 years, although his supporters protest to date.PROSECUTIONS RAREProsecutions and convictions are rare in the DRC yet corruption allegations predate the current administrationPrime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga said “the scarcity of public resources is the result, among other things, of the ineffectiveness of the system to fight fraud and corruption resulting from an obsolete and non-computerised system, as well as the lack of a tax culture”.Officials reportedly collude to dodge taxes, overprice projects or simply work with private investors to take kickbacks.Sometimes, senior government officials register companies but claim tax exemptions even when the services offered are not included in the exemptions.They have even monetised their signatures, according to information from the General Inspectorate of Finance.“More than 40 per cent of public revenue goes to tax exemptions and reductions,” the inspectorate said in a statement.“This clearly means that most of the State's revenue is no longer collected because of the rights acquired by thousands of operators, who exclude entire operations from their contribution to the national effort.”KEY ISSUESAccording to figures from the Ministry of the Budget, the number of exemptions granted is excessive and their rationalisation will be the first problem.For example, the exempted value in the first quarter represents 45.75 per cent of the imported value. It was 43.14 per cent at the same period in 2019.As for the compensations granted, the balance to be compensated in the first quarter amounted to 188 billion Congolese francs ($96 million).Last week, President Tshisekedi ordered the inspectorate to carry out “a rigorous control of the exemptions granted and to examine conformity to the law.It will also investigate the granting of procedures and the possible connection with “mafia networks of fraud by interposed administrations”.Inspectorate head Jules Alingete says it will rapidly deploy its control network.\",\n",

REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon (* Any views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation.By Helen Clark, former New Zealand Prime Minister and Chair of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Illicit financial flows affect development for the rich and poor alike globally. The United Nations found that the people of Africa lose around £88.6 billion in illicit capital flight every year at a time when the continent faces costs of more than $200 billion just to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and governments can ill afford to see such wealth sent abroad.Regrettably, around half of this sum is estimated to relate to transactions in the extractive industries – mining, oil, and gas – where investors frequently set up complex webs of companies and use anonymous ownership arrangements to hide corrupt deals.Nor is this just a problem for Africa; low-income countries around the world are believed to lose up to a trillion dollars of revenue each year as a result of corrupt deals.Given the necessity of minerals for the energy transition, it is welcome that this issue is gaining more prominence internationally. In June 2021, G7 leaders confirmed their commitment to transparency and international action against corruption.But the countries most affected, and the industries where so much of the corruption takes place, need to be at the forefront in putting in place the reforms and systems which will shine a light on the shadowy structures often used to rob low-income countries of the means for development.Over the next five years, the initiative I chair – the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) – will work with transparency group Open Ownership to make beneficial ownership registers a reality in more countries through a Programme funded by the BHP Foundation. To date, seven resource rich countries across three continents – Mexico, Zambia, Ghana, Mongolia, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the Philippines – have agreed to take part.Corporate leadership is also required. This week, a range of companies have committed to support transparency by disclosing information on the beneficial owners of companies and subsidiaries, and rigorously assess this data as they undertake due diligence on partners and suppliers.Systems for publishing contracts and information are not a guarantee against corrupt deals, but they do enable journalists, anti-corruption bodies, and prosecutors to gather evidence of malfeasance and bring it to light.One recent example is a deal concluded in the resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where businessman Dan Gertler, currently under U.S. sanctions for alleged corruption in mining deals in the DRC, was able to buy a substantial share in a major cobalt project through a chain of companies, none of which bore his name. The transaction was only identified when contracts on the project were published, providing evidence of his involvement and of the terms of the sale.Publishing and maintaining comprehensive registers of beneficial owners is a complex task, to which over 110 countries have already committed.Implementing the necessary legal reforms is one step, but robust technical approaches are also required. Data must be collected, verified, and published in a way that is easily accessible, enabling analysis such as that recently undertaken in Colombia where thousands of data points were compared to link extractive contract holders with politically exposed persons.Under the programme, expert technical teams will work alongside governments and other stakeholders in focus countries to support reforms, ensuring greater access to beneficial ownership information. Systematic disclosures of this information will enable cases of corruption and mismanagement to be more easily identified and addressed.We look forward to updating on our progress over the next few years. Beneficial ownership transparency is one of the best weapons we have to fight illicit financial flows and corruption. We are calling on every government and extractive company to commit to this agenda.If we succeed, the prize is large. It means countless billions of dollars going not into the pockets of corrupt officials or businessmen, but rather into economic and social investments to drive sustainable development.\\xa0Bleak houses: Families struggle to foot France's soaring energy billsPoor countries' debt rose 12% to record $860 bln in 2020- World BankWhy are power outages paralyzing Lebanon?Lebanon's crisis pushes mental health services to the limitOur global editorial team of about 55 journalists and more than 350 freelancers covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.Copyright © 2020 Thomson Reuters Foundation.

It passed with 367 of 377 votes.Under the DRC’s constitution, parliamentary censure requires the prime minister to step down within 24 hours.“One of my missions is to control the executive which, if it does not meet the concerns of the people, must be removed,” member of parliament and author of the no-confidence motion, Cherubin Okende, told Reuters news agency.\",\n",

oversee a motion of no confidence.Tshisekedi’s new political alliance, known as the Sacred Union, is yet to be officially formed, but is likely to be comprised of more than 20 parties, giving him an overwhelming majority to pass legislation.However, political analysts say Tshisekedi may also find it difficult to juggle the diverging interests of his coalition.Tshisekedi won a controversial presidential election in December 2018 on a platform vowing to fight corruption, reduce inequalities and improve government.But he says his campaign of reform has been thwarted by Kabila’s lieutenants, who account for two-thirds of the vast 65-member coalition government.Still only 49 years old despite his 18 years in office, Kabila retains clout through allies in politics, the military and business.He took the helm of the DRC in 2001, succeeding his father, Laurent-Desire Kabila, who was assassinated by a bodyguard.The younger Kabila’s rule was fiercely criticised for corruption and poor governance.But it ended peacefully when he stepped down, in the DRC’s first-ever bloodless transition since gaining independence from Belgium in 1960.Follow Al Jazeera English:Naughty, not

They don’t pay taxes — it’s unfair competition,” says Felicien Liofo, head of a wood craftsmen’s association.Local police say soldiers simply rip apart the fences around the forest and threaten to shoot anyone who tries to stop them.Felicien Malu, a provincial environment coordinator, has roughly 1,200 workers to cover a province twice the size of Portugal.But his staff, he says, are not paid and lack even the basic tools of their trade — boats, motorcycles or pickup trucks.“We can’t organize control missions because there are many rivers to cross and unpaved roads,” he says.His predecessor in the job was suspended for embezzlement, underlining how corruption feeds the problem of deforestation.Greenpeace Africa and a coalition of eight NGOs from DRC and neighboring Congo-Brazzaville have demanded a halt to all industrial activities in the millions of hectares of peatland shared by the two countries.The ancient wetlands store huge amounts of carbon, but companies are involved in oil exploration, logging and industrial agriculture in the area.Global Witness investigated the illegal logging trade and earlier this year accused a general in the Congolese army of illegally reselling logging permits.However, DRC remains impoverished and electricity is a rare luxury, meaning that most Congolese still rely on charcoal as their main fuel supply.\\xa0The trade in charcoal — known locally as makala — is worth millions of dollars and it is attracting armed groups to the Goma area, threatening Virunga natural park, a sanctuary for endangered mountain gorillas.Kinshasa residents consume five million tonnes of wood a year, according to French research group Cirad, and increasing urbanization is just raising the pressure on the forests.On the hillsides around the capital, there are scarcely any trees left.NGOs and the government are once again trying to respond.The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is trying to minimize the impact of charcoal burning by introducing “eco makala” ovens that burn the fuel more efficiently and so use less wood.And President Felix Tshisekedi is trying to boost electricity across the country to reduce demand for wood-based fuel.He has championed hydroelectric power — and ground was broken in early October on a new dam in Goma.NGOs and locals are not convinced of the viability of the project, but Tshisekedi is adamant: “Given the current rate of population growth and our energy needs, our forests may disappear by the year 2100,” he says.Log in to leave a comment See the difference EXPLORE MOREPublished Friday, Dec. 3, 2021,  9:01 amJoin AFP's 100,000+ followers on FacebookPurchase a subscription to AFPSubscribe to AFP podcasts on iTunes and  SpotifyNews, press releases, letters to the editor: augustafreepress2@gmail.comAdvertising inquiries: freepress@ntelos.netClimate Action Alliance of the Valley Steering Committee member Earl Zimmerman brings us this latest installment of Climate and Energy News. For an\\xa0archive\\xa0of prior posts, visit the CAAV website.“All our major energy challenges are connected in complex ways both globally and nationally. Energy security, energy affordability, and the protection of the environment, the three pillars of energy policy, are inextricably linked.”—Neil Hirst,\\xa0The Energy Conundrum: Climate Change, Global Prosperity, and the Tough Decisions We Have to MakeAfter two decades of climate negotiations, we all got a\\xa0reality check\\xa0at the recently concluded COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow. The climate has already heated by 1.1°C above preindustrial levels and there is a fifty-fifty chance that global warming will exceed 1.5°C in the next two decades. It is estimated to reach 2.7°C at the end of the century. To keep global warming to the 1.5°C limit proposed at the Paris Climate Summit in 2015, we will need to halve global carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But achieving these goals requires an effort unlike any that humanity has undertaken before.The African continent is already suffering and will continue to suffer the\\xa0worst economic and social effects\\xa0of rising temperatures in the coming decades. This will especially affect children and youth, as half of Africa’s population is under the age of 20. Yet little was accomplished at the Glasgow Climate Summit to address how to compensate African countries for the damage created by centuries of fossil fuels and other emissions in rich countries. It also failed to agree on a meaningful plan to help African countries alleviate that damage while sustainably developing the capacity to meet their own rapidly growing energy demands.Using language normally applied to conventional adversaries like China and Russia, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin recently described the climate crisis as “a profoundly destabilizing force for our world.” To counter this threat the\\xa0Department of Defense\\xa0will have to mobilize its capabilities as if preparing for a major war. This will not be an easy task because the Pentagon is the nation’s leading institutional consumer of fossil fuels and the single largest institutional producer of greenhouse gases in the world. The U.S. cannot, therefore, reduce its national greenhouse gas emissions rapidly without a sustained drive by the Pentagon to\\xa0abandon carbon-based fuels\\xa0in favor of renewable energy.Experiencing a climate disaster and\\xa0living with climate change\\xa0as a constant threat on the horizon creates climate anxiety and changes how we think about our own existence. Yale psychologist Sarah Lowe advises:Following the COP26 climate summit, President Biden has submitted a treaty fighting climate\\xa0super-pollutants\\xa0for Senate approval. These hydrofluorocarbons, widely used in refrigeration and air conditioning, are hundreds of times more potent than carbon dioxide. There appears to be broad bipartisan congressional support for this effort.During his campaign, Virginia governor-elect Glenn Youngkin said that he wouldn’t have signed the\\xa0Virginia Clean Economy Act, saying it was too costly and “puts our entire energy grid at risk.” Even so, energy experts say he will find it hard to significantly weaken or slow down the law, given its ongoing support in the State Senate and the staggered board terms at two key regulatory agencies. He would not only have to contend with a Democrat-controlled Senate but also Republican legislators who favor the law and\\xa0an electorate\\xa0that broadly supports it. Furthermore, he has spoken favorably of renewable energy and has expressed support for offshore wind in Virginia.Sea level rise and more frequent intense rainstorms are putting pressure on communities in Virginia, especially in the Eastern Shore and Hampton Roads regions. Some state officials are, therefore, pushing for the creation of\\xa0a state flood board\\xa0to better coordinate and utilize more than $64 million in funds earmarked for flood protection, which Virginia has received\\xa0in 2021 from its participation in the\\xa0Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, an 11-state cap-and-invest carbon market on the East Coast of the United States.Our changing climate is playing havoc with our transportation system, buckling concrete and flooding roads. The federal Infrastructure Bill recently signed into law includes $7.3 billion for states to spend on\\xa0transportation resilience\\xa0projects. Another $1.4 billion for competitive grants would give cities and counties federal help to adapt their road networks.Climate migrants are\\xa0roiling politics\\xa0across the United States. People displaced by Hurricane Maria in 2017 have changed the political demographics of the Orlando area of Florida where the Puerto Rican population has grown by more than 12%. Less dramatically, people in low-lying areas of Virginia are moving to less flood prone areas. Of the quarter million Louisianans who fled New Orleans for Texas after Hurricane Katrina, about 40,000 stayed bringing more non-white and Democratic voters to formerly conservative precincts. And people in Boise, Idaho, are concerned about the political ramifications of migrants from California who are relocating because of drought and wildfires.Dangerous mining conditions, political gamesmanship, and corruption plague the Democratic Republic of Congo, home to the\\xa0world’s largest supply of cobalt, a key ingredient in electric cars. A\\xa0Chinese company\\xa0bought two of the country’s largest cobalt deposits over the past five years while both the Obama and Trump administrations stood idly by.Norilsk, a Siberian city, which is one of the most polluted places on earth, now aims to ramp up production to sell the high-purity metals needed for batteries and other technologies of the clean energy economy. In another development, the\\xa0state of Alaska\\xa0has approved building a highway to facilitate mining for minerals used for solar panels and other green energy. The highway, which has no other purpose, will endanger a pristine Alaskan wilderness above the Arctic Circle.Ever larger offshore\\xa0wind turbines\\xa0are driving down costs, making it competitive with the costs of electricity from natural gas power plants. (Onshore wind and solar are still cheaper than all other alternatives). Another benefit is that offshore wind farms can be built close to major population centers. This is especially encouraging for states like New Jersey and Virginia, which have laws requiring the construction of offshore wind.Despite the green image, putting acres of solar panels on undeveloped land is environmentally problematic. In contrast, the benefits of installing them as\\xa0canopies on parking lots\\xa0are that they are abundant, close to customers, largely untapped for solar power generation, and on land that has already been stripped of much of its biological value. Even so, solar canopies are barely beginning to show up in our country’s endless acreage of parking lots but that is beginning to change. For instance, the Washington, D.C., Metro transit system has just contracted to build its first solar canopies at four of its rail station parking lots, with a projected capacity of 12.8 megawatts.European countries searching for a long-term and constant source of energy to complement the intermittent energy of wind and solar green sources are increasingly looking to\\xa0nuclear power\\xa0to help them reach their ambitious climate goals. France and England are looking to the next-generation technology of small modular nuclear reactors that supporters say are safe, cheap and efficient. Eastern European countries especially see such nuclear power as an alternative to their long-standing dependence on coal. Alternatively, Germany is at the head of a group of other European nations that want to defuse efforts to include more nuclear power in Europe’s green energy mix because of their concerns about safety and radioactive waste.Reductions in home energy use and residential greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved in a variety of ways, including through modifications to improve the efficiency of existing structures, and standards and building techniques that promote better energy performance in new homes. Policies that\\xa0Local Housing Solutions\\xa0proposes to achieve this include:The\\xa0sustainable industrial revolution\\xa0is just getting started but there are some promising initial developments. Heavy industries like shipping, steel and plastics contribute 40% of global carbon emissions, but have long opted out of climate action. This is starting to change. For example, electric motors consume about half of the world’s electricity. Infinitum Electric, a start-up company in Texas, is now developing a new\\xa0efficient motor design\\xa0that replaces the copper wire and laminated iron core found in conventional motors with a printed circuit board stator, making the motor smaller, lighter and much more efficient. In another promising breakthrough, the Swedish steel maker SSAB has begun developing a\\xa0fossil fuel-free steel making process\\xa0where iron ore is refined, or reduced, with green hydrogen and renewable energy. The iron is then shaped into finished steel with electric arc furnaces.Ann Arbor, Michigan has set an ambitious goal of being carbon neutral by 2030. This goal is especially audacious given that the city’s electric provider DTE Electric remains tethered to coal and natural gas. To work around that, Ann Arbor plans to set up its\\xa0own sustainable community-based electric company\\xa0which will generate renewable power, incorporate battery storage and tie homes and businesses to micro-grids.Ithaca, New York, also just made an unprecedented move to tackle its carbon footprint with the goal of being carbon neutral by 2030. Its electric grid already receives 80% of its power from renewable sources, so instead, they will focus on the full\\xa0decarbonization of city buildings\\xa0which consume 40% of the energy in the city. Because it would be impossible to fund such a huge effort with the city budget and other public funds, they have initially lined up $100 million in private financing through their private equity partner Alturus to fund the work of BlocPower, their building energy efficiency partner.Compiled by Earl Zimmerman, CAAV Steering CommitteeEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\",\n",

aid sector accountable shine light similar abuses become member today support independent journalism': 'Request an institutional free trial for your entire organization.‘We do not want our report to jeopardise humanitarian aid in a context where some actors are already seeing a diminishing level of resources.’Correspondent and Editor, AfricaAn operational review that detailed widespread corruption and sexual exploitation in humanitarian aid operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been made public after a draft version was leaked to The New Humanitarian.The final version of the 80-page review – funded by DFID, the UK government department responsible for overseas aid – shows the domino effect of corrupt practices in Congo, impacting everything from staff recruitment to the delivery of aid. The report was released on Monday, a month after TNH obtained a draft.Sexual abuse and exploitation by aid workers was described as being widespread, with very few cases having been investigated because of ineffective reporting systems and perpetrators using money and influence to keep survivors and their families quiet.Parts of the final report – which comes as cash-strapped governments look to cut aid amid the COVID-19 pandemic – have been altered compared to the draft copy TNH obtained as part of a months-long investigation into aid operations in Congo, where hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid are spent annually.Read more → EXCLUSIVE: Leaked review exposes scale of aid corruption and abuse in CongoThe draft version made allegations that the selection committee of Congo’s humanitarian pooled fund – a major pot of funding run by the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, OCHA – had demanded kickbacks from national NGOs in exchange for contracts. The final version anonymises the funding mechanism, drawing attention away from the UN.Language was also changed in a section on the death of Cameroonian epidemiologist, Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, who was killed in April 2019, in an attack while working for the World Health Organization during the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo.The draft version suggested that the doctor was murdered after raising concerns about questionable practices in the response, which the authors identify in both copies as including the rental of vehicles at “exceptionally” high prices and large payments to security services for military escorts. These practices created “significant tensions” among individuals who sought to benefit from response funds, according to the review.“Attempts by some whistle-blowers to denounce certain practices have at best been stifled and at worst have resulted in death, such as the case of Dr Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung,” the draft said.But in the more vaguely worded final version, the doctor’s killers are alleged to have “targeted the Ebola response and those that represented a possibility to the reduction of circulating resources”.François Grunewald, one of the report’s authors, told TNH his team was not pressured to modify the document and explained the changes by saying they “didn’t want to create such a shock and antagonise organisations to the point of not achieving our objectives”.“We do not want our report to jeopardise humanitarian aid in a context where some actors are already seeing a diminishing level of resources due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.A well-placed source who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue said OCHA and the WHO were “unhappy” with the draft report and requested details be changed because agencies had agreed to participate on the basis that individual organisations would not be singled out.The source added that the authors had veered outside the agreed scope of the review, which was intended to identify common issues and risks affecting humanitarian organisations in Congo – not investigate particular agencies.Joseph Inganji, the head of OCHA in Congo, told TNH that the agency did not ask for the pooled fund section to be changed. He said he wrote to the authors requesting clarity on the allegations as part of the review’s agreed process and that the authors had made an independent decision.“We never asked it to be removed,” he said.The WHO did not immediately respond to questions on Wednesday.The operational review – written by independent consultants contracted by the aid consultancy firm Adam Smith International – was commissioned earlier this year by an anti-fraud taskforce created by UN agencies and aid groups in Congo after the NGO Mercy Corps discovered a large-scale fraud scheme in late 2018.Read more → EXCLUSIVE: Congo aid scam triggers sector-wide alarmAccording to an internal Mercy Corps investigation, the multi-layered aid scam – first made public after a nine-month investigation by TNH – likely affected multiple NGOs and went undetected for more than a decade, triggering sector-wide corruption concerns.The UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Congo, David McLachlan-Karr, said on Monday that the report’s recommendations would be reviewed by aid groups in Congo and a “roadmap” for future actions laid out by September.Grunewald said he and others would be running a series of remote workshops with aid organisations in the country to discuss the report’s findings.Five million people are currently displaced in Congo, which is one of the world’s longest-running humanitarian crises. Hundreds of thousands of people have been uprooted in recent months alone.pk/pd/agIt was The New Humanitarian’s investigation with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that uncovered sexual abuse by aid workers during the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of Congo and led the World Health Organization to launch an independent review and reform its practices.This demonstrates the important impact that our journalism can have.\\xa0But this won’t be the last case of aid worker sex abuse. This also won’t be the last time the aid sector has to ask itself difficult questions about why justice for victims of sexual abuse and exploitation has been sorely lacking.\\xa0We’re already working on our next investigation, but reporting like this takes months, sometimes years, and can’t be done alone.The support of our readers and donors helps keep our journalism free and accessible for all.

headline politics daily newsletter best journalismpublished since september take part severe contest intelligence presses forward unworthy timid ignorance obstructing progress copyright economist newspaper limited rights reserved': 'A top aide to Democratic Republic of Congo president, Felix Tshisekedi, has been arrested and detained on allegations of misappropriating public funds.Vital Kamerhe, the chief of staff and a coalition partner to Tshisekedi was picked up on Wednesday, questioned and subsequently detained by police in the capital Kinshasa. The president’s spokesman, Kasongo Mwema, told the media: “The president does not comment on the decisions of the justice system.”Police were forced to use tear gas to disperse Kamerhe faithful who had gathered at the public prosecutor’s office. The action was to enforce a ban on public gathering of more than 20 persons as a containment measure related to the coronavirus pandemic.Reports indicate that in his hometown of Bukavu, located in eastern Congo, protests were held outside his party headquarters as hundreds of young people burned tyres and blocked roads.Kamerhe’s arrest is seen by anti-corruption campaigners as a vindication of reports about corruption in high places within the government. But for President Tshisekedi, who took power in January 2019 campaigning to root out corruption, the development is a blow to his efforts.The police chief of the capital, Kinshasa, confirmed to Reuters that the embattled official was driven by police to the Makala prison where he is being held. Sylvano Kasongo did not disclose what specific charges Kamerhe faced.Kamerhe has, however, denied all allegations of impropriety.Kamerhe’s Union for the Congolese Nation (UNC) party announced a coalition in Nairobi with the then main opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) led by Tshisekedi. The CACH coalition won the December 2018 polls and Tshisekedi was sworn in.One of the first appointments after taking office was announcing Kamerhe as chief of staff even though many had expected him to be named Prime Minister. The leader of government position was handed to Illunga Ilunkamba, a trusted political hand, months after Tshisekedi took office.Analysts say the arrest could further weaken the coalition under whose terms Tshisekedi is expected to back a UNC candidate when next elections are held. Jason Stearns, director of the Congo Research Group at New York University says internal politicking from day one showed that the coalition was heading for breakup: “The coalition was important ahead of the elections, but ever since he was inaugurated, there have been people around Tshisekedi pushing him to get rid of Vital,” Stearns said.Domestic failures in themselves do not explain the global inequality of outcomes when it comes to vaccines.The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is taking its toll across the world, with many countries reporting higher than ever numbers of infections and hospitalisations. The good news is that in countries where vaccines are available there are overall lower mortality numbers, affirming that at a community level, vaccines are working. The bad news is that with a conspiracy of international politics, profiteering and domestic complacency, the vast majority of the world’s population remains unvaccinated. As of July 2021, only 25.3 percent of the world’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and of the 3.4 billion doses that have been administered worldwide, only one percent has been administered in low-income countries.We are free-falling into an era of unprecedented inequality, thanks in great part to the poor decisions being taken by the world’s political class. The world was already deeply unequal with poor countries carrying the lion’s share of the global disease burden with sparse resources. But despite assertions that this pandemic would be a great equaliser, it is instead turning out to be an accelerator of inequality. The wealth of the world’s billionaires grew by 45 percent or about $1.3 trillion since the first COVID-19 cases were recorded in China’s Wuhan province in December 2019, yet by United Nations estimates, global unemployment will rise to its highest levels in history with more than 200 million new cases as a direct result of the pandemic.All of which makes the current global vaccine inequality particularly threatening. Billions of lives are at risk because rich countries are standing in the way of making vaccines more freely available, threatening to compound the already exacerbating inequalities. In contrast, 69 percent of Canada’s population of 38 million has received at least one dose of the vaccine while only 65,000 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (population 89 million) have received at least one dose. Between them, United States pharmacy chains Walmart and CVS have wasted at least 180,000 doses of vaccine – more than most African countries have administered. And the COVAX initiative, designed to make global access to vaccines more equitable by coordinating countries to buy enough vaccines for 20 percent of their populations so that at least all healthcare workers in the world could be vaccinated – has run out of vaccines. COVAX was purchasing most of its vaccines from India, but the “vaccine factory of the world” has introduced export controls after being battered by the third wave of COVID-19.If countries like Haiti and Chad, which have not officially administered a single dose of any vaccine, do not quickly protect their front-line healthcare workers, the risk is not only that those people will lose their lives but that already weak healthcare systems will collapse. People have not stopped catching other diseases or needing treatment for other things just because of COVID-19, and if vulnerable countries lose a critical mass of their medical professionals, this may cause a lag that will take generations to overcome.But it did not have to be this way. Since the start of the pandemic poor countries have been making the tough policy decisions needed to keep the outbreak at bay. Strict lockdowns have kept hospitalisations low. But these public health measures have also crippled economies and led to epidemics of unemployment and hunger. Millions of migrant workers and day labourers have lost their jobs because of the often brutally enforced shutdowns but have borne the burden because the promise was that it was a temporary situation designed to hold the outbreak back until a longer-term solution was found. People are hungry, angry and frustrated but instead of working fast to make the medium-term solution that now exists more quickly available, rich countries and the pharmaceutical industries they protect are playing for profits.Certainly, the lack of vaccines in some poor countries is in part a function of their poor domestic policies. In Kenya, Cameroon and South Africa, the pandemic response has been riddled with allegations of corruption and the misappropriation of public funds. In September 2020, Kenya’s auditor general shared that the country had lost $2.3m in a procurement scandal at the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) which was to oversee the purchase of PPE in the country. In South Africa, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize was put on leave in June 2021 after a scandal involving the irregular allocation of communications contracts in support of the pandemic. Tanzania and Madagascar had the misfortune of living under presidents who either denied the existence of the disease or the utility of scientific treatments.But these domestic failures in themselves do not explain the global inequality of outcomes when it comes to vaccines. First, even within Africa, these countries are outliers. The majority of African countries have no corruption scandals associated with their pandemic responses to date and instead have been faithfully, if sometimes slowly, allocating resources to the rising threat of the pandemic. For example, Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) received 600,000 doses of vaccine from COVAX. Initial uptake of the vaccine was slow owing to a great deal of public hesitancy, but despite the political uncertainty in the country created by the 2021 election, the government countered the misinformation and has to date vaccinated 850,000 people. In short, Cote D’Ivoire has used up its COVAX allocation and then some, but now there are no vaccines left to buy.More importantly, corruption in COVID-19 responses is not a uniquely African problem. In April 2021, international anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International found that one in five government contracts allocated by the UK government as part of their coronavirus response contained “one or more red flags for corruption”. And yet, just under 68 percent of adults in the UK have already been vaccinated. Indeed, according to the Lancet, the UK secured five bilateral deals for 270 million doses of vaccine against a population of 66 million, or enough for 225 percent of its population. Yet the UK also paid $98m for 27 million doses of vaccine from COVAX and in April 2021 received 500,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine through COVAX. It is not enough to simply point to corruption as the reason why African countries do not have access to vaccines.In fact, there is a global traffic jam in the vaccine supply chain, with manufacturers unable to keep up with the global demand. In large part, this is because rich Western countries broke an agreement to begin with vaccinating front-line healthcare workers around the world before opening up vaccination to the general population. At an April conference on vaccine availability in Africa, Stephane Bancel, CEO at Moderna, told attendees that he had no spare capacity – every time a box of vaccines is finished in the plant it is immediately shipped out for delivery. So what are we to infer, if, according to the company’s own website, not a single drop of Moderna vaccine has been made available in a poor country? And what will it mean now that rich countries are talking about diverting some of that capacity towards the manufacture of booster shots?COVAX was supposed to be a fairness pause, an opportunity to give all the countries in the world a fighting chance in the context of the anthems of global solidarity that were being sung during the worst of the outbreak in the West. China has promised 110 million doses of its Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines to COVAX which should help, but is not enough to bridge the gap. The third wave is already here, and with new variants that could undermine the efficacy of existing vaccines. We need a fairness pause, but in the medium term, the easiest way to ease this traffic jam would be to make it possible for more countries to make vaccines. Cuba is leading the way by making its vaccine technology more freely available. Gamaleya (the maker of the Sputnik vaccine) has also promised to share its technology with manufacturers in Argentina. This is a big part of the multi-pronged strategy that African countries – and indeed many other countries around the world, including India – are advocating for. Waiving patent rights would allow countries with manufacturing capacity to copy the formulae for the vaccines without fear of punishment.It is perfectly valid, and indeed crucial, to demand accountability from corrupt governments. Domestic activists are already doing that because we cannot let governments off the hook for the theft and the waste. But these demands will come to nought if rich countries attempt to use charity as a buffer for injustice. We cannot demand that our governments reprioritise spending towards the purchase of vaccines if there are no vaccines to buy. And we cannot save the lives that are under threat right now because of this third wave if we are only expected to wait for leftovers that are scheduled to come long after the emergency has landed.The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.Follow Al Jazeera English:Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Governments scrambled to limit the transmission of Omicron, the latest strain of covid-19, which initial evidence suggests spreads faster than earlier mutations, including Delta. First identified in South Africa, Omicron has been detected in dozens of countries. The World Health Organisation warned that Omicron poses a “very high” global risk. Joe Biden said it was “a cause for concern, not a cause for panic”. The governments of Israel and Japan stopped foreigners from crossing their borders. Restrictions on travel from southern Africa were imposed by America, Britain, the European Union, South Korea and a host of other countries.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said it was time for all EU member states to discuss whether to make covid-19 vaccines mandatory. So far, only Austria has done so.Australia delayed a further easing of its border restrictions by a fortnight because of Omicron. Singapore tightened its entry procedures, but its land border with Malaysia, one of the world’s busiest crossings, was reopened to vaccinated travellers. It had been shut for 20 months.The UN issued a report on Afghanistan’s economy. It predicted that GDP will shrink by 20% within a year. Foreign aid, which had accounted for 40% of GDP, has been sharply curtailed since the Taliban’s military takeover in August. Their policy of making it hard for women to work makes the country poorer. Stopping girls from going to school will, in the long-run, have an even worse economic effect.In the Philippines an ally of the president, Rodrigo Duterte, withdrew from the presidential race. The exit of Christopher “Bong” Go leaves the government without a candidate in May’s election, though Mr Duterte’s daughter, Sara, is running for the separately elected post of vice-president. Ferdinand Marcos junior is the front-runner for president.India’s fertility rate fell below replacement level. An Indian woman can expect to have 2.0 children, down from roughly six in 1947. The country’s population is now predicted to peak a decade earlier than previously expected, at perhaps 1.6bn people in 30 years, and then to shrink.Russia and America traded angry words over Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, warned the Kremlin, which has been massing troops at the border with Ukraine, not to invade. If it does, he threatened economic sanctions rather than an American military response. A day earlier Vladimir Putin had described any deployment of NATO troops or missiles in Ukraine as “red lines” for him.The European Commission launched what it is calling its Global Gateway scheme, an attempt to rival China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative. The idea is to use EU investment guarantees to help raise as much as €300bn ($340bn) of public and private investment in the developing world. Critics say this is mostly a repackaging of various existing schemes.Talks on the future of the nuclear deal signed between Iran and six world powers resumed in Vienna. Joe Biden wants to revive the agreement, which his predecessor ditched three years ago. Western diplomats were guardedly optimistic after Iran agreed to discuss steps to come back into compliance with the deal. But international inspectors also reported that Iran was continuing its nuclear work.Back in Iran, big demonstrations rattled the regime. Riot police were deployed in the city of Isfahan, where thousands of residents protested about a lack of water. Locals say a long-running drought has been made worse by official bungling and the diversion of water to other cities.Conservationists flew 30 white rhinos from South Africa to Rwanda. It was the largest such airlift aimed at protecting the endangered animals.Uganda fired shells and launched air strikes across its border into the Democratic Republic of Congo. It hit camps used by the Allied Democratic Forces, a rebel jihadist group that was behind two deadly bombings in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, in November.America’s Supreme Court heard arguments about abortion. A law in Mississippi bans most abortions after 15 weeks. It has not been enforced because the Supreme Court has held for nearly half a century that states may not ban abortion before a fetus is viable. Pro-life activists hope, and pro-choice activists fear, that the current court will reverse this ruling and return the matter to the states. If so, several states would quickly ban most abortions.America’s air-force secretary said his country was engaged in an “arms race” with China in the development of hypersonic weapons. He said this did not necessarily involve boosting their number, but rather their quality. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has said that China tested such technology this year, calling it close to a “Sputnik moment”.The Women’s Tennis Association suspended its tournaments in China. It cited uncertainty surrounding Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis star who last month accused a former deputy prime minister of sexually abusing her. The WTA worries that Ms Peng has been silenced.Xiomara Castro was declared the winner of the presidential election in Honduras. Ms Castro is from the left-wing opposition. Her win marks the first real political change for over a decade in a country riddled with corruption and organised crime. She campaigned as a moderate, though many of her allies are on the far left.Fifty-five years after gaining independence from Britain, Barbados became a republic, removing the British monarch as its head of state. At a ceremony on the Caribbean island, Prince Charles acknowledged the “appalling atrocity of slavery”. One of the first acts of the new republic was to proclaim Rihanna, a pop star born in Barbados, a national hero.This article appeared in the The world this week section of the print edition under the headline \"Politics\"A daily newsletter with the best of our journalismPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” Copyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2021.

It is a major barrier to economic growth, good governance and basic freedoms, such as freedom of speech or citizens’ right to hold governments to account.More than this, corruption affects the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities.The 10th edition of the Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Africa, reveals that while most people in Africa feel corruption increased in their country, a majority also feel optimistic that they, as citizens, can make a difference in the fight against corruption.Global Corruption Barometer (GCB) – Africa | Transparency InternationalOur research shows that more than half of all citizens think corruption is getting worse in their country and that their government is doing a bad job in tackling corruption.The report also found more than one in four people who accessed public services, such as health care and education, paid a bribe in the previous year.This is equivalent to approximately 130 million citizens in the 35 countries surveyed. Conducted in partnership with Afrobarometer and Omega Research, the GCB is the largest, most detailed survey of citizens’ views on corruption and their direct experiences of bribery in Africa. The survey incorporates the views of more than 47,000 citizens from 35 countries across Africa.Citizens think the police is the most corrupt institution, with 47 per cent of people believing that most or all police are corrupt. These results are consistent with findings from the 2015 report.Unsurprisingly, police also consistently earn the highest bribery rate across Africa. Other public services like utilities, including electricity and water, and identification documents, including licenses and passports, also have high bribery rates.Bribery does not affect all people equally, it hits the poorest harder than the wealthiest – often denying people access to critical healthcare, education and legal protections, with devastating consequences. Young people, aged 18-34 years, are more likely to pay bribes than older people, aged over 55 years.Paying bribes for essential public services means poorer families have less money for other necessities like food, water and medicine.Governments have a long way to go in regaining citizens’ trust.Yet, despite this, African citizens think change is possible.Several countries stand out for their bribery rates and corruption levels, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Mauritius. Eighty-five per cent of citizens in the DRC think corruption is getting worse, which is the highest in the region. The country also has the highest bribery rate on the continent (80 per cent of public service users), with the police earning the highest bribery rate of any country across any sector - 75 per cent of those who came into contact with the police paid a bribe.By contrast, Mauritius has one of the lowest bribery rates in the region (5 per cent), with the police also earning a low bribery rate (5 per cent). Given these positive results, it’s no surprise that more than 55 per cent of Mauritians think that reporting cases of corruption will lead to proper action.As part of our analysis, we compared citizens’ views of corruption among Members of Parliament (MPs) with other indices, like the Clean Elections Index, which measure corruption in national elections and found a direct link. Non-African actors also play a significant role in fuelling corruption in Africa through foreign bribery and money laundering. Too often, countries that export large volumes of goods and services around the world, fail to investigate and punish companies that pay bribes.In turn, political leaders make deals with foreign businesses to promote their personal interests at the expense of the citizens they serve.Tackling corruption in Africa requires a holistic, systemic approach. Some of our top recommendations to African governments include:Governments of major economies, including G20 and OECD countries, and offshore financial centres should:Business leaders around the world should implement international anti-corruption and anti-money laundering standards.Read the full report on the Global Corruption Barometer Africa 2019:  For the full list of countries surveyed and information on the survey approach, please see here.

access decision making essential regain citizen trust democracy ensure policies meet people needs': 'More than one in three Africans believe there is endemic corruption in politics in their country, according to our latest survey conducted with over 47,000 respondents in 35 countries across Africa. The most concerned citizens are found in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where 79 per cent think that all or most parliamentarians are corrupt, followed by Gabon with 71 per cent. However, there are countries where citizens rate the integrity of their parliamentarians much higher. For example, in Cabo Verde and the Gambia, only 15 per cent and 16 per cent of respondents respectively think that all or most parliamentarians are involved in corruption. The survey results are based on nationally representative face-to-face interviews between September 2016 and September 2018, conducted in partnership with Afrobarometer. The survey in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was conducted by Omega Research. What accounts for such a wide disparity in peoples’ perceptions of the integrity of elected representatives in different countries? In this piece, we will to look at various forms of political corruption, how they manifest in African countries and what can be done to promote political integrity.One of the foundations of our democratic institutions is the social contract between voters and elected representatives. Politicians are entrusted with power in order to represent the interests of the general public. Political integrity means that politicians act in the public interest, rather than serving private interests. The separation of the public and private spheres is paramount in the exercise of political integrity. Politicians won’t always make decisions which align with the short-term preferences of everyone, but it does mean they act in a way which is consistent with a set of moral or ethical principles and standards. Political corruption is the manipulation of policies, institutions and rules of procedure by political decision-makers who abuse their position for private gain. This takes the form of gross conflicts of interest, where elected politicians and their families or cronies hold substantial business interests. It takes the form of abuse of state resources, such as investing in unnecessary projects right before election campaigns. It takes the form of businesses bankrolling political candidates to turn them into their clients. What all these factors have in common is the spilling over of private interests into the public sphere and decision-making.State capture occurs when corruption is so systemic within the institutions of the state that private interests substitute their own interests for the common good as the main drivers of policy and regulation.\\u202fWhen the state is captured, companies and individuals shape and affect the formulation of laws and regulations through illicit payments, such as bribes to parliamentarians and public officials. Illicit contributions during electoral campaigns, and influencing key public sector appointments are other methods that ultimately lead to\\u202fan\\u202ferosion of\\u202fpublic trust in public institutions.\\u202f In\\u202fSouth Africa, where\\u202four survey finds that 38 per cent of citizens\\u202fthink that all or most in the office of former President Zuma were corrupt, and 44 per cent believe that all or most parliamentarians are corrupt, the issue of\\u202fmoney in politics and undue influence of private interest on public policies has been a very hot topic lately. A recent inquiry\\u202fon state capture\\u202ffound that a private\\u202fcompany\\u202fwas bribing politically connected individuals and the ruling African National Congress. According to\\u202fofficial testimonies,\\u202fthe company paid monthly bribes of US$250,000 – US$400,000 to senior government officials. As Corruption Watch, our national chapter in\\u202fSouth\\u202fAfrica put it, “under the direction of the company’s CEO bribes were paid to the President and his close associates, to leading cabinet ministers and to senior officials in the National Prosecuting Authority in order to obtain multi-million Rand public contracts and to ensure their impunity.\\u202fIn the process, they not only subverted the objectives of the public procurement system thus elevating costs and undermining the quality of public services, but they also contributed to the near-destruction of the key law enforcement agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting perpetrators of corruption.”Conflicts of interests occur when a person is in a position to derive personal benefit from actions or decisions made in their official capacity. Such situations risk placing the private interest of the political decision-makers above the public interest. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the family of former President Kabila has partial or full ownership of over 80 companies active in sectors such as farming, mining, banking, real estate, airlines and telecoms. Most of these sectors require businesses to acquire permits and contracts from the government. Indeed, the Kabila family benefits from large permits as well as joint ventures and subcontracts that exceed the limits set in the DRC’s legal code. During Kabila’s tenure, an estimated US$4 billion went missing every year, in part due to dubious public procurement practices.A common avenue for money to enter politics, besides direct bribes paid to senior officials, is through the financing of political parties. When elected, politicians can give preferential treatment to companies or groups who bankrolled their campaigns. At the same time, when political contestants do not have to declare the sources of funding and campaign expenditure, the costs of election campaigns increase and the risk of illegal expenditure increase, such as vote buying.*The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption, ratified by 40 countries, specifically requires state parties to incorporate the principle of transparency into political party funding, and to proscribe the use of funds acquired through corruption.Despite some African countries recently initiating public debates on political finance reform (here and here), change is very slow to happen in most countries. Even when laws exist, implementation and enforcement are very poor. A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, argues that the financing of political parties in Nigeria “has served the purposes of consolidating elite rule as well as the political exclusion of the non-elite.” Our GCB survey finds that over 60 per cent of Nigerians believe that most or all of their MPs are involved in corruption.The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, our national chapter in Nigeria, argue that laundered money is often used for political campaign financing and vote-buying during elections. Election management bodies and other relevant oversight and law enforcement agencies often lack the appropriate mandate, independence and resources to ensure that laws are enforced. Civil society organisations and the media do not have the space or resources to monitor who is funding political candidates, and whether these same donors are more likely to enjoy preferential treatment once those they have funded come to power.* The 5th edition of an Afrobarometer survey found that 15% of Africans had been offered financial incentives to vote one way or another at an election.The abuse of state resources, defined as undue advantages obtained by certain parties or candidates through use of their official positions or connections to governmental institutions, to influence the outcome of elections, is a grave breach of political integrity as it gives incumbents an unfair electoral advantage (see here and here). A 2013 study on abuse of state resources in Uganda found a textbook catalogue of such abuses, including using government facilities for political purposes, money from state revenues being used for partisan purposes, a supplementary budget passed six weeks before the election included US$4.2 million for youth unemployment.In this year’s edition of the GCB, 78 per cent of Ugandans said that the government is doing badly in the fight against corruption and 69 per cent said that corruption is increasing. Almost two in five citizens in Uganda believe that most or all of their top politicians are corrupt.In 2012 Kofi Annan wrote: “Building democracy is a complex process. Elections are only a starting point but if their integrity is compromised, so is the legitimacy of democracy.”  We find that citizens tend to perceive their top politicians to be less corrupt in countries which perform well on electoral integrity, as measured for example by the Clean Elections Index.**Electoral integrity refers to the appropriate conduct of all parties involved in elections, including candidates, voters and election management authorities. In fact, expert assessments of corruption, as reflected in the Corruption Perceptions Index scores are even more closely associated with the Clean Elections Index than people’s perceptions, as seen in the GCB. This may be due to public opinion data being more volatile and sensitive to high-profile cases that receive considerable attention in the media.** The Clean Elections index is comprised of the following dimensions: Election Oversight Body autonomy and capacity, Election voter registry, Election vote buying, Election other voting irregularities, Election government intimidation, Election other electoral violence, Election free and fair. For more, please consult the V-Dem codebook.One of the best performers in this edition of the GCB is the small West African state of Gambia. The majority of Gambians (54 per cent) said that the government is doing a good job in the fight against corruption. Sixty-seven per cent of them said that they trust the president “somewhat” or “a lot”. Members of the Parliament also enjoy a high integrity rating, with only 15 per cent of Gambians thinking that they are involved in corruption (less than half the average for Africa, 36 per cent).Since the ousting of autocratic ruler Yahya Jammeh, Gambia has improved markedly across different governance indicators, including an upgrade from “Not Free” to “Partly Free” in the Freedom House ratings as well as an improvement from “repressed” to “obstructed” in the CIVICUS assessment of civic space and notably a 40 per cent improvement on the Clean Elections Index score. All these changes followed the 2016 elections, deemed peaceful and credible by international observers.After 22 years of patrimonial rule, where the misuse of state resources was normal, Gambians seem to have placed their trust on their new democratically elected representatives, who have vowed to uphold political integrity and deliver results for ordinary citizens. Gambians have taken a great leap towards democratic consolidation, however much more work is needed to ensure that transparency and accountability follow the political opening. Despite recent improvements and an apparent commitment to transparency and accountability by the current president Adama Burrow, political integrity remains a key challenge in Gambia.Although ministers in the new government were supposed to disclose their assets by July 2017, as of yet many of them have failed to do so. Worryingly, the reform-minded president’s family where involved in a controversy when his wife’s foundation was found to have accepted a donation of US$752,594.42 by a company competing for a government tender on electricity distribution. The matter is being investigated, and the way it is handled will show whether Gambia is truly committed to political integrity, or whether vested private interest will continue to dominate politics.Crucially, political corruption excludes and disenfranchises large swathes of the population, particularly those who are less well connected and powerful. Across Africa, only 41 per cent of citizens are satisfied with how democracy works in their country. Worryingly, those living in high poverty are more than 15 percentage points more likely to say that most or all politicians are involved in corruption, as compared to the richest respondents.Corruption erodes citizen trust in democratic institutions and leads to political apathy, which in turn further fuels corruption. Open, fair and accountable access to decision-making is essential to regain citizen’s trust in democracy, and to ensure policies meet people’s needs.',\n",

It is winding down now, with no new cases recorded in over a month.President Felix Tshisekedi stripped him of his role managing the Ebola response last July and he resigned from the government days later, criticizing actions taken by Tshisekedi. He was arrested in September.Ilunga’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday, but they have previously denied all the allegations.The court convicted Ilunga and his financial advisor of forging receipts worth $391,332 from a fake company, referred to as New Sarah pharmaceutical depot, to justify purchases of products already paid for by international donors.The pair diverted a further $13,000 intended to pay for transport of life-saving goods to Ebola hotspots, the court found.The judgment marks the first time a minister from former President Joseph Kabila’s government has been convicted for corruption since Tshisekedi took power last year. Ilunga was nominated by Kabila but remained in his post for months while negotiations about Tshiskedi’s first cabinet dragged out.Having run on an anti-courruption ticket, Tshisekdi’s declared ambitions to clean up public finances have been hampered by an awkward power-sharing deal with Kabila, whose allies control a majority of ministries and seats in parliament.The hundreds of millions of dollars pumped by foreign donors into the response to Congo’s Ebola outbreak, the second deadliest ever, raised fears of corruption after the response to West Africa’s even larger 2013-16 outbreak was dogged by allegations of graft.Reporting by Stanys Bujakera, writing by Hereward Holland; Editing by Aaron Ross and Angus MacSwanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

In April, President Felix Tshisekedi ousted the last remaining elements of his government who were loyal to former leader Joseph Kabila in the culmination of a long campaign to take full control of the country. It was a secret power-sharing deal with Kabila that initially brought Tshisekedi to power, naming him the winner of the rigged 2018 elections over Martin Fayulu, who was widely-acknowledged as the true victor of the popular vote. Now, more than two years into his tenure, Tshisekedi has thrown off the vestiges of the Kabila “puppet master” and is poised to pursue his own political agenda. \\xa0Tshisekedi seems poised to make regional integration a cornerstone of his independent administration, throwing off the country’s moniker as “Africa’s problem child” to build closer political and economic ties with other states in the region. Not only have such efforts gained traction on the continent in recent years, but Tshisekedi is also keen to distance himself from the foreign policy of his predecessor, emphasizing his own multilateral ambitions in contrast to Kabila’s “brinksmanship” approach to diplomacy. But while Tshisekedi has touted regional cooperation as a key priority, his wholesale campaign to discredit political opponents suggests that he has not fully set aside the authoritarian tactics favored by Kabila.Tshisekedi’s ties to “the Congo strongman” have hurt him from the start of his administration. He initially campaigned against endemic political issues, with promises to curb rampant corruption, raising average wages, and resolve instability in eastern DRC. This reform-minded agenda was explicitly presented as a foil to Kabila, who has been widely-condemned in the country as a leader willing to ignore crises to secure his own political power. But the power-sharing deal that brought him into office unexpectedly put Tshisekedi in the position of working with Kabila, not against him. The perceived power struggle between the two men sparked national outrage the new president spent his first two years in office on political squabbling rather than fulfilling his campaign commitments. Now, fully in control of his government and with an eye towards the 2023 reelection cycle, Tshisekedi is in desperate need of an image overhaul.The bureaucratic cycles of regional institutions seem perfectly aligned to give Tshisekedi the multilateral legitimacy he so desperately needs. In February, the DRC took over the rotating chairship of the African Union (AU), giving Tshisekedi a full year at the helm of the continent’s largest institution. The country is also poised to ascend to the East African Community (EAC) after years of delay, with regional partners optimistic about the prospects of building ties with Tshisekedi independent of Kabila’s influence.Tshisekedi has wasted no time in outlining ambitious plans for the DRC’s forthcoming institutional engagement. His agenda for the AU chairship prioritizes regional integration, enhancing economic ties and calling on African partners to help curb insecurity in the eastern DRC. He has also committed to investing in AU-U.S. relations, seeking to rebuild ties after previous AU leaders distanced themselves from the Trump Administration amid his travel ban on many African countries.Commentary on the DRC’s likely ascension to the EAC has tended to focus on the economic advantages of the move, which is anticipated to jumpstart Tshisekedi’s development agenda and bring renewed revenue flows to African businesses struggling with the economic fallout of Covid-19. Growing trade relations with the East African bloc may also deepen political integration in the region, limiting China’s influence in the DRC; Beijing currently supplies nearly a third of the country’s total imports. Particularly with other regional leaders speaking out against China’s so-called “debt-trap diplomacy,” Tshisekedi’s adoption of African trading partners in lieu of Beijing will certainly come as a welcome signal of cooperation. Shared institutional interests through the EAC may also present a forum for unifying economic bonds or deeper security cooperation to address rebel activity in the DRC’s Ituri and Kivu provinces.Tshisekedi’s campaign to build ties with other African powers has been extensively covered in recent weeks, with reporting of the “new” DRC emerging under his leadership. Just a few months into his independent rule, Tshisekedi is already reaping the benefits of his modernizing agenda that presents him as an engaged, issue-focused leader – a reputation he hopes will cement his stake in the DRC’s 2023 elections. But as a leader that himself came to power through a backroom deal, Tshisekedi knows better than most that popularity alone is not a guarantee of security.Mere weeks after ousting pro-Kabila elements from his government, Tshisekedi took the unprecedented step of declaring a “state of siege” in eastern DRC, effectively imposing martial law on the Kivu and Ituri provinces that have faced rebel violence and insecurity for decades. While particular attention to these regions is certainly warranted, commentators agree that Tshisekedi’s move was a political message more than anything else. According to Africanist Phil Clark, the real message is that “whenever the opposition rules the provincial government, you get mass violence, you get this mass insecurity.”The reform-minded leader with ambitions for regional integration is only one side of Tshisekedi. Beyond the modernizing face is a fundamentally insecure president who fears being supplanted by a wildcard candidate, just as he cut a deal to edge out Fayulu in 2018. The reliance on Kabila-esque tactics to suppress opposition voices in Eastern DRC represents the other side of the “new” DRC. Janus is now in charge.',\n",

They were briefed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bintou Keita.The members of the Security Council welcomed the efforts of President Tshisekedi towards reconciliation and peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They further welcomed the steps he has taken to fight corruption and impunity, and encouraged further action to ensure the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo respects human rights and fundamental freedoms.The members of the Security Council took note of the efforts towards forming a Government to deliver on President Tshisekedi’s commitments to pursue national unity, strengthen the rule of law, and further political inclusiveness and peacebuilding. They further took note of President Tshisekedi’s intention for that Government to be composed of 30 per cent of women.The members of the Security Council noted that political stability and security, as well as increased State presence in areas of conflict are critical for the consolidation of sustainable peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It follows a proclamation issued by outgoing US President Donald Trump on Tuesday night.  Washington suspended DR Congo from the  African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) some 10 years ago because of alleged human rights violations under former president Joseph Kabila.The decision affirms President Tshisekedi’s efforts to reform and strengthen the DRC’s democratic institutions, protect human rights, and fight corruption.Since its enactment in 2000, AGOA has been at the core of US economic policy and commercial engagement with Africa.It provides eligible Sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to the US market for over 1,800 products. That adds up to more than 5,000 products eligible for duty-free access under the Generalized System of Preferences program.DR Congo\\'s main exports, copper and cobalt, are included in the agreement but are already tariff-free under the System of Preferences.  The announcement comes during a turbulent period in the DRC\\'s politics. President Tshisekedi, who has been in office since January 2019, ended a coalition in December which was dominated by supporters of his powerful predecessor Joseph Kabila, who ruled for 18 years. The move prompted abrawl in parliament with ministers overturning desks and throwing chairs.“It is recognition of President Tshisekedi’s commitment to bringing about the change the Congolese people desire and deserve,” Mike Hammer, the US ambassador to Congo, said in a statement.  “The return of DRC to AGOA is a significant achievement that is a clear manifestation of our Privileged Partnership for Peace and Prosperity,\" said Mike Hammer, the US ambassador to Congo. The United States established the US-DRC Privileged Partnership for Peace and Prosperity in 2019 to combat corruption, protect human rights, strengthen democratic institutions.The partnership seeks to confront potential pandemics, promote peace and security, build a stronger bilateral relationship, and deliver results for the U.S. and Congolese people.\\'\\'The reinstatement of AGOA eligibility is another landmark achievement showing the progress made toward our shared goals.\\'\\'',\n",

Designed as a shared roadmap for member states to implement governance and anti-corruption measures, the convention aims to eradicate corruption in government and business. Today, 44 of the 55 member states have ratified the convention, yet there is little information on how well it is implemented in practice. A new report by Transparency International explores this, looking at three important areas: money laundering, illicit enrichment and political party funding, as well as the role civil society and media play in fighting corruption.Money laundering facilitates heinous crimes that damage the lives of millions of Africans across the continent. When criminals make money through arms sales, poaching or corruption, they need to make the cash appear clean before they can use it. Under the AUCPCC, countries are meant to make money laundering illegal. Most countries have done so, but the convention does not give them a framework for how to prevent it, nor does it equip authorities with the tools they need to investigate and prosecute money launderers. Another problem is a lack of data on how effective the tools in place actually are. Based on what data there is, it seems that most countries could be doing a lot more.To effectively track and prosecute money laundering, African governments need to dedicate more resources to specialist skills, such as financial analysts and tax inspectors, and improve cooperation between these experts and prosecutors. Just as important is ensuring complete independence of authorities and courts to prevent well-connected money launderers from escaping prosecutions and convictions. The Mozambican courts stood up against high-level corruption in 2020: a former transport minister was put on trial for money laundering in connection with the national airline’s purchase of two Embraer planes. Embraer admitted to paying bribes to Mozambican officials to secure the deal. The courts also prosecuted a middleman for laundering the bribe payments through a shell company. In order to increase transparency and monitoring, disaggregated data on cases like this should be published annually, specifying the charges and outcomes.',\n",

Illicit enrichment is a crime under the AUCPCC, though few member states do enough to enforce the laws. The offence is notoriously difficult to prosecute, not least because many suspected offenders are high-profile and well-connected figures, who often enjoy political immunity. This often involves unduly influencing judges: in Nigeria, a serving judge of the Federal High Court had received US$260,000 – paid into his personal bank account over a two-year period – and was unable to show a legitimate source of the deposits. Still, the appeals court dismissed all charges on procedural grounds. The lack of necessary expertise and tools coupled with the limited autonomy of justice authorities are key challenges in fighting corruption across the continent. As a result, most countries have only prosecuted a few officials - in some countries, none at all. African governments need more robust systems in place to make it illegal and very difficult for public officials to enrich themselves through corrupt acts. The burden should lie with the accused to explain and prove the legitimate sources of their assets and – if they fail to – conviction and forfeiture should follow. This would require authorities to have full independence to investigate and prosecute, and more specialist skills to do so. As with money laundering, reliable data on the effectiveness of enforcement is scarce, making monitoring challenging. Data on prosecuted cases and outcomes should be made publicly available on an annual basis.A new Transparency International report assesses the state of implementation of the AUCPCC in 10 countries and aims to support policy-makers and civil society members from these countries to identify key challenges that need to be addressed to improve both the legal framework and enforcement in four key areas of the convention.When money from opaque and unregulated sources is allowed to infiltrate politics, it becomes difficult to hold politicians and their parties accountable. Lack of transparency in political party funding also allows hidden actors to finance and buy politicians for their own interests – states get captured by the corrupt.Compared to some other anti-corruption treaties, the AUCPCC is unique in placing a clear obligation on state parties to legislate for and effectively enforce transparency requirements for political party funding. However, most countries fail to expressly ban the use of illegally acquired funds in political financing. Even where strong legislation is in place, it is rarely enforced, and when enforcement does occur, sanctions are either too lenient or too severe: some overly light sentences fail to discourage offenders while in other cases political parties get broken up, which harms democracy. In the last decade, Tunisia has policed money in politics unevenly. During the 2011 elections, authorities actively fulfilled their oversight responsibilities, imposing sanctions for party funding violations and even annulling certain election results. Since the rules were relaxed in 2014, reports of unsanctioned overspending',\n",

However, parties only received warnings, which haven’t led to widespread change in behaviour.African governments should adopt measures to prohibit dirty money funding their political parties, and close loopholes such as third-party donations or sponsorships that can serve to hide the origins or the actual recipient of the money. Placing limits on how much a single donor can donate over a given period of time could help prevent a party from owing favours to wealthy individuals. Parties should be required to make all financial reports publicly available every year, with additional reporting before and after major elections. Additionally, sanctions should be reviewed to ensure they are proportionate and, as such, more effective. When it comes to investigating and drawing attention to abuses of power and corrupt practices, civil society and media play a critical role. The impact they can have is seen in South Africa, which has a vibrant and diverse civil society and media landscape, in particular through specialist investigative journalist groups. In 2017, for example, South African journalists exposed the corruption connected to a campaign of provoking of racial tensions that was led by the Gupta family and a British public relations firm.But civil society and media can only hold governments and elected officials accountable when citizens have freedom of expression and access to information. The AUCPCC introduces a requirement for extensive rights to information, in particular for the media, but its scope is non-specific and governments are managing to limit what they reveal. All member states should review their legislative framework on freedom of expression, association and information to ensure their media and civil society can operate free of interference and intimidation. When allegations of harassment, violence or indiscriminate arrests of journalists and activists occur, these should be vigorously investigated. State interference in media reports should be avoided, and refusals of requests for information should be subject to appeal or review. Our report aims to support policy makers and civil society members to identify key challenges to address in order to improve both the legal framework and the enforcement of selected anti-corruption provisions contained in the AUCPCC.

DAS Bradley also met with the Coordinator of the Agency for the Prevention and Fight Against Corruption, the Inspector General of Finance, and Executive Secretary of the Financial Intelligence Unit to accelerate efforts to bring corrupt individuals to justice. Bradley highlighted how INL assistance can strengthen their institutions’ ability to investigate allegations of human rights abuses and hold corrupt actors accountable, as well as the need to protect whistleblowers and journalists who expose criminal activity.With Vice Minister of Interior Jean Claude Mol and the Congolese National Police, Bradley reiterated the U.S. commitment to supporting police reform in the DRC, including an additional program that will focus on improving police accountability. In addition, the Ministry of Environment briefed Bradley on Vice Prime Minister Bazaiba’s reform agenda to better ensure DRC’s natural spaces and wildlife are protected for the benefit of the Congolese people and the world. Eliminating illicit economic activities will contribute to promoting peace and security in Eastern DRC.In Nord Kivu, Bradley met with Vice Governor General Romy Ekuka, environmental lawyers, and visited Virunga National Park to observe INL-funded programs and how they are combatting mineral and wildlife trafficking that fuels crime and instability. Together with the Congolese National Police, Bradley participated in the signing of the transfer of a new INL-funded mining police station for Walikale. Twenty-eight newly trained police will work with community leaders in Walikale to combat mineral trafficking and prevent child labor. In Virunga, Bradley met with DRC’s first ever park ranger pilot trainees who, through support from INL, will strengthen surveillance and detection of illegal activity throughout the park, that will contribute to the fight against wildlife trafficking.“We created this partnership and will continue to provide this assistance in North and South Kivu because tackling mineral and wildlife trafficking contributes to a more stable security environment for the citizens of the DRC, which is essential for the country’s prosperity,” Bradley explained.Regarding his visit, DAS Bradley concluded: “From President Tshisekedi to committed police leaders who want change, I heard acknowledgement of and steadfast determination to tackle corruption, which President Tshisekedi rightfully called ‘the gangrene that is everywhere.’ INL looks forward to expanding our work together to enable DRC to deliver results for the Congolese people, reach its true economic potential, and become a net contributor to regional peace and security.”The Bureau of INL, part of the United States Department of State, fights crime by helping foreign governments build effective law enforcement institutions that counter transnational crime, combats corruption, and builds transparent and accountable public institutions—a cornerstone of strong, stable, and fair societies.By U.S. Embassy Kinshasa | 3 August, 2021 | Topics: Press ReleasesFooter Disclaimer This is the official website of the U.S. Embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

They include OCIDC, ODEP and the APLC, which are civil society groups and coalitions demanding transparency from President Felix Tshisekedi and a government long known for lining the pockets of elites at the expense of its citizens.The fake YouTube channel comes amid renewed interest in international businessman Dan Gertler, a close associate of former president Joseph Kabila who was placed under sanctions by the United States in 2017. Those sanctions were eased last month as former U.S. president Donald Trump was leaving office.It also follows the emergence of two Afriland First Bank whistleblowers, auditors Gradi Koko Lobanga and Navy Malela, who have agreed to testify about Gertler’s activities despite the consequences for their own safety. Afriland was named in a July 2020 report from the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa and Global Witness, which charges the bank is at the center of a scheme used by Gertler and his associates to work around the sanctions.“These revelations have led to investigations by international media outlets that will be published in the coming days,” said PPLAAF on Friday.President Xi Jinping of China has pledged to deliver another 1 billion COVID vaccine doses…',\n",

Please try again later.DAKAR, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo should renegotiate its $6 billion infrastructure-for-minerals deal with Chinese investors, according to the draft of a report commissioned by a global anti-corruption body of governments, companies and activists.The draft, seen by Reuters, describes the deal that was first signed in 2008 as \"unconscionable\" and urges Congo\\'s government to cancel an amendment signed secretly in 2017 that sped up payments to Chinese mining investors and slowed reimbursements of investment in infrastructure.The final report is expected to be released this month by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which tracks revenue flows in the oil and mining sectors and counts more than 50 countries, including Congo, as members.The report has no legal force but, if the draft\\'s main conclusions remain, it could bolster Congo\\'s push to secure more favourable terms from mining contracts with Chinese investors.  read more President Felix Tshisekedi\\'s government is reviewing the 2008 contract and the reserve levels at China Molybdenum\\'s (603993.SS) Tenke Fungurume mine after saying Congo was not getting a fair deal.Prime Minister Sama Lukonde Kyenge told a mining conference on Thursday: \"There has to be some adjustment.\"The moves represent rare pushback by Congo, the world\\'s leading producer of the battery metal cobalt and Africa\\'s top copper miner, against the Chinese investors who control most of its mining industry.Under the 2008 deal struck with the government of former President Joseph Kabila, Chinese state-owned firms Sinohydro Corp (SINOH.UL) and China Railway Group Limited agreed to build roads and hospitals financed by profits from Congo\\'s Sicomines cobalt and copper joint venture.Critics say few of those projects have been realised.Congo\\'s government spokesman said he had not read the draft and could not comment. EITI\\'s office in Congo referred Reuters to the terms of reference of the mission and declined to comment further. A Sicomines representative did not respond to requests for comment.A copper and cobalt mine run by Sicomines is seen in Kolwezi, Democratic Republic of Congo, May 30, 2015. REUTERS/Aaron Ross/File PhotoChina Railway had no immediate comment. Sinohydro did not respond to a request for comment.Fred Zhang, a senior Sicomines official, defended the deal in comments to Reuters last week, saying it had driven development for Congo\\'s people and Sicomines would disburse more funds as production rose.\\'DENUNCIATION\\'The draft, written by two Congolese consultants, recommends \"the denunciation by the Congolese state of the unconscionable character of the joint-venture convention of April 22, 2008 and the return to the negotiations table by Sicomines shareholders\".It says the Chinese companies\\' 68% stake in Sicomines is too high since the Congolese contributed all the mining assets and 32% of the initial capital.It condemns the previously undisclosed 2017 amendment.Under the 2008 contract, all of Sicomines\\' profits would initially go to reimbursing investments in Congo\\'s most urgent infrastructure projects. It was on that basis that parliament agreed to exempt Sicomines from all taxes, the draft says.Under the 2017 amendment, seen by Reuters, only 65% of Sicomines\\' profits must initially go toward reimbursing the investments while 35% goes to shareholders.The change could further slow the pace of the infrastructure projects, the draft says. To date, less than $1 billion of the expected $3 billion has been invested, about $1 billion less than projected at this stage, it says.\"This amendment constitutes a violation of the security of the interests of the Republic,\" the draft says.The draft report calls for re-evaluating Sicomines\\' reserves, saying a 2010 feasibility study 2010 was flawed, and cancelling another contract with the same Chinese investors to build a hydroelectric dam.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Those sanctions excluded him from the\\xa0American financial system and blocked access to his\\xa0American accounts. The Trump administration in its final hours in office quietly eased those sanctions. Their easing, while not necessarily illegal, violated usual Treasury procedures and has\\xa0provoked outrage among human rights activists in the United States, the DRC, and elsewhere. Critics see the reprieve as a part of President Trump's wave of pardons to criminals with good connections. According to the media, the Biden administration is likely to reverse the move.Eastern Congo is a stark example of great wealth—mostly based on the strategic minerals that have made Mr. Gertler rich—amidst grinding poverty. Militias and gangs, allegedly with ties to neighboring Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda, are active. Ethnic conflict is widespread. Criminality, sometimes with political links, is ubiquitous. Ebola recurs; new cases\\xa0have been reported this month. Government at the national and provincial levels is notorious for corruption and appears largely alienated from the people who live there. The DRC is far from fulfilling the basic requirement of sovereignty—guaranteeing the security of its citizens.The ambassador's reputation was that he was devoted to his humanitarian mission, that he was judicious, and did not take unnecessary risks. The road traveled by the convoy was regarded as safe. So, what group killed the Italian ambassador? It may have been by a group with a political agenda. But the event also has elements of being primarily a criminal enterprise: after capturing the ambassador, the perpetrators moved him into the bush, in what is believed to have been an attempted kidnapping. He was killed only after security forces attempted to rescue him.More on:\",\n",

Congolese authorities should instead investigate the allegations of criminal activity reported by Gradi Koko and Navy Malela, two former bank employees who exposed alleged illegal financial practices and money laundering.Koko and Malela both worked in the audit department of Afriland First Bank CD, the Congolese subsidiary of Afriland First Bank, whose headquarters are in Cameroon. Koko said that in 2018 his superiors at the bank directly threatened him after he reported serious financial irregularities internally. In the face of these threats, he and Malela shared a trove of data and documents with the Platform for the Protection of African Whistleblowers (PPLAAF), a nongovernmental organization based in France. The information they provided led to a series of investigative reports in July 2020 by PPLAAF, Global Witness, and media outlets, including Bloomberg, Le Monde, and Haaretz.“Congolese authorities have made a mockery of the rule of law by prosecuting two whistleblowers for revealing information of major public interest that’s critically important to Congolese institutions,” said Thomas Fessy, senior Congo researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Their convictions should be quashed, and their revelations should be the basis for independent and impartial investigations.”The published reports allege that Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a longtime friend of former Congo President Joseph Kabila, established a money laundering network with Afriland First Bank CD at its center. The scheme purportedly helped Gertler evade United States government sanctions against him and to acquire new mining assets in Congo.Koko fled Congo in 2018 and sought asylum in Europe; Malela followed in early 2020. On February 26, 2021, they revealed that they were the source of the reports.“I am not an armed rebel chief and my denunciations are useful to Congo, so why should I be sentenced to death?” Koko told Human Rights Watch by phone. “I fear reprisals, and I fear for my family in Kinshasa.”On February 25, representatives for Afriland and Gertler told journalists at a news conference in Kinshasa that the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Kinshasa had sentenced the whistleblowers to death in absentia on September 7 for “forgery,” “theft,” “private corruption,” “breach of professional secrecy,” and “criminal conspiracy.” Neither Malela nor Koko – or their lawyer – had knowledge of the court hearing. The trial violated the men’s right to a fair trial under international law, Human Rights Watch said.Shortly after the February 25 news conference, a Congolese news outlet posted a copy of the verdict online and shared it on social media. “How could we possibly discover the copy of this judgment, of which we had no knowledge, on social media?” Koko said.The verdict reiterated unfounded and baseless allegations against PPLAAF and Global Witness that first emerged after publication of their July 2020 report. It included claims made in video clips shared by newly created social media accounts that the organizations had used underhanded methods to collect their information. In a statement issued on March 5, Global Witness said the “the false and highly defamatory allegations … [had] no factual basis whatsoever.”On February 26, new investigations based on another batch of leaked bank records reported more details about Gertler’s elaborate system of alleged money laundering, and showed that Afriland First Bank CD also harbored accounts for several companies tied to alleged financiers of Hezbollah and people suspected of links to North Korea’s armament program. Other records showed large sums of money allegedly transiting through the personal accounts of some Congolese officials.Afriland First Bank CD denied all allegations of wrongdoing to Radio France Internationale. Gertler has also rejected all accusations of corruption and sanctions violations and said that Koko and Malela were “victims” of “appalling conduct” by anti-graft organizations.Also on February 26, a fake YouTube channel was created impersonating the anticorruption watchdog Transparency International. The channel posted videos targeting anticorruption organizations working in Congo. It followed a months-long online smear campaign and abuse against the investigative consortium that revealed the alleged money laundering ring in 2020.The latest revelations came a month after it emerged that Gertler had been granted a special license by the Trump administration in its waning days, effectively lifting US sanctions against him for one year. On March 8, 2021, in response to domestic and international outrage, the Biden administration revoked this license, reiterating that Gertler had “engaged in extensive public corruption.”The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office and the embassies of Belgium, France, and the US have all raised concerns about the sentences handed down against Koko and Malela. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty. \\xa0Congolese authorities should immediately exonerate Koko and Malela or risk deterring future whistleblowers, Human Rights Watch said. The government should provide both men’s families in Congo with physical protection, while any intimidation and harassment against them should be investigated.The government should investigate and appropriately prosecute the allegations of illegal practices within the banking system.“Whistleblowers take enormous risks to contribute to a healthy democracy and defend the public good,” Fessy said. “The real culprits should be found among those whose impunity allows them to siphon Congo’s wealth and hinder its development.”European Development Banks’ Link to Abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Palm Oil IndustryThe Impact of Lead Contamination on Children’s Rights in Kabwe, Zambia\",\n",

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a Strategic Partner. moreThe primary and secondary education sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faces massive challenges. These include insufficient budgets, payroll fraud, a lack of infrastructure and teaching material, and poor opportunities for teacher professional development. Educational officials aren’t being held accountable for policy failures.One of the biggest hurdles has to do with the teacher payroll. In general, the  country’s teachers – more than 500,000 – work under dire conditions. In particular, a significant number of school teachers in the DRC have gone without government pay for several years. Since the early 1990s, parents have been called upon to step in to support teachers and schools financially by paying substantial school fees. Providing quality education isn’t always at the top of teacher priorities as they struggle to supplement their income with other activities. Two years ago, the government decided to abolish primary school fees. The idea was that the government would pay all teachers. However, drawing on our long engagement with the DRC’s education sector and political system, we believe that this will be a challenge because of political, budgetary and administrative issues. In April this year, Tony Mwaba, one of the most ferocious critics of corruption in the education sector, was appointed the new minister of education. This followed the conviction of former education officials, including the former minister of education, for corruption and money laundering. Is this the start of a serious reform of the battered education sector? We believe that sustainable change in this system would require a thorough restructuring of the mechanisms of political accountability. In the meantime, we can only expect a realignment of existing patronage networks to the political agenda of the current president.In November 2020, the DRC’s auditor general published a report which revealed the depths of the payroll crisis. Masses of teachers remained unpaid while new ones were being added to the payroll. There was also an influx of administrative staff, diverting resources from teacher salaries. The report revealed the embezzlement of 62 billion Congolese francs (about US$30 million) and other forms of payroll fraud.Payroll fraud permeates the public sector, and this has been a persistent problem in the DRC. The report implicated senior civil servants and staff from the ministries of budget and finance, education and the teachers’ payroll agency. The issue reverberated in the provinces as well. Several officials were placed under arrest.The boundary between “state” and “society” has become a twilight area in the DRC, whose dynamics are governed by specific social pressures, economic rents and political considerations. For example, relationships with politicians, due to party affiliation or origin, increase a school’s chances of being added to the payroll. Another example is the attempted removal of 1,179 schools from the payroll. As reactions by educational leaders suggest, some of these schools have properly functioned for decades. In the past, masses of other schools have obtained their decree via informal processes, void of any educational planning. What is the difference between schools functioning on “false” decrees, and schools functioning on decrees based purely on patronage without any technical preparation and monitoring?Government actors who benefit from the current structures have few incentives to clean up the payroll. However, teacher union politics also partially explains these continued dynamics. There’s a lack of strong, independent unions and a lack of trust between teachers and unions. Also the political co-option of union leaders, for example by mobilising them as consultants or by inviting them into party politics, has weakened the unions’ impact. Out of 40 unions, only a handful can be considered to be functioning properly. With a dozen pseudo-unions and a high number of unions which hardly function, Congolese teacher unions have been effectively silenced.Trying to reform human resource and payroll management means taking away a massive resource of patronage and electoral politics from hundreds of bureaucrats and politicians.Public statements to fight against payroll fraud seem to materialise at strategic moments. In 1979, the former president of the Democratic Republic of  Congo (then Zaire), Mobutu Sese Seko, stated that:We’re going to wipe out the imaginary schools and the fake teachers who exist only on paper. For Mobutu, it was a way to attract World Bank funding. So, what was the reason for the most recent announcement? The investigations, and Mwaba’s appointment, are nested within Congolese political dynamics, and it is necessary to look beyond the education sector. For 15 years, according to our sources, the education ministry functioned as a cash cow for long-term ruler Joseph Kabila’s party. When Félix Tshisekedi was elected president in 2019, in what is seen as a rigged election, he formed a coalition with  Kabila. The investigations and sentences of high-level educational officials sit within Tshisekedi’s much wider use of “judicial harassment” against key persons from Kabila’s camp.   Given that Tshisekedi’s coalition remains unstable and based on members of parliament who will “condition their support upon payments or extractive opportunities”, he will need all possible sources to gather funds. This is all the more the case as the DRC looks forward to a new round of elections in 2023.So this is the situation in which the president finds himself: while the judicial investigations and new appointment indicate that using the payroll for patronage purposes is being addressed, now that he’s completely in power himself, Tshisekedi might be tempted to deviate from the norms through which he won his position. With an education sector struggling to cope through patronage politics and informal arrangements, and with all of the high level dynamics at play, can the new education minister bring much needed change? We truly hope so, but he would have to swim against a strong tide. For a longer French version of this article, please see here.\",\n",

The delegation also held discussions with the National Assembly leadership including President Mboso, Vice President Kabund, and new Human Rights Committee Chair Iyananio Moligi where we discussed important legislative initiatives like a new Anti-human Trafficking Law, the recently passed CENI law, as well as the law affording the autochthonous people’s protections. Plus, Ambassador Peterson met with National Police leadership, representatives from DRC’s Council of Bishops (CENCO) and Church of Christ in Congo (ECC), Congolese civil society leaders, one of the leaders of the opposition Martin Fayulu, and senior officers from the UN Stabilization Mission in the Congo (MONUSCO).\\xa0Throughout the visit, Ambassador Peterson stressed the importance of civilian protections and accountability for human rights violations.\\xa0\\xa0“I served previously in Kinshasa in the 1990s and during this visit I was impressed with the palpable change that is taking place with a clear opening of political space and a serious commitment by the government to improving human rights.\\xa0 These positive developments under President Tshisekedi’s leadership are important but, as we discussed during the Dialogue, more progress is necessary.\\xa0 That is why during our talks we pledged to increase our cooperation to address continuing concerns about press freedom, and\\xa0child labor, as well as to improve gender equality.”\\xa0Together with DRC government interlocutors, Ambassador Peterson underscored that the state of siege in eastern DRC highlights the critical need to strengthen protections for Congolese citizens, who have suffered from brutal violence for far too long at the hands of armed groups, terrorists and criminal gangs.\\xa0 Ambassador Peterson also highlighted the importance of protecting and preserving fundamental freedoms and civic space for all Congolese, and of ensuring that human rights defenders, journalists, and civil society members can express themselves freely without fearing reprisals or abuse from state security forces.\\xa0 Ambassador Peterson agreed with her Congolese counterparts that ending impunity must be a priority, whether in the case of the\\xa0murders of UN experts Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalan or all those crimes committed against Congolese citizens in Eastern DRC over the past twenty years, including by using the UN’s Mapping Report to seek justice. The United States is also actively supporting legislative reforms to protect freedom of expression\\xa0in DRC, including an access to public information law and decriminalizing press offenses in the 1996 Press Freedom Law, as well as protecting freedom of expression and the right to protest free from arbitrary arrest.\\xa0During a working session on combatting human trafficking, Ambassador Peterson worked with focal points from various government ministries to identify best practices for protecting trafficking victims, urging DRC improve coordination among\\xa0government entities and to adopt a clear government process for referring trafficking victims to care. She also urged defense ministry officials to continue working to prevent any recruitment of children by armed groups and during a roundtable alongside DRC government counterparts and civil society leaders, the United States committed to support Congolese efforts to ensure\\xa0a\\xa0free, fair, transparent, credible, and on-time election\\xa0in 2023.\\xa0At the U.S-DRC Human Rights Dialogue, Ambassador Peterson announced new U.S. technical and financial assistance and the expansion of existing American programs designed to assist DRC in its human rights goals.\\xa0These include:The U.S. and DRC agreed to have a second formal human rights dialogue in one year.By U.S. Embassy Kinshasa | 18 June, 2021 | Topics: News, Press Releases | Tags: cooperation, democracy, Fight against corruption, human rights, human rights issue, Lisa Peterson, peace and security issues in Africa, PP4PP, trafficking in persons and DRCongo, Trafficking in persons;, U.S.-D.R.C partenrshipFooter Disclaimer This is the official website of the U.S. Embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Trump’s administration.The United States first froze Gertler, a mining mogul, out of the U.S. financial system in 2017, weeks after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ Paradise Papers investigation. Officials accused Gertler of having “amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).” The sanctions were extended in 2018. Gertler denies wrongdoing.In January, the outgoing Trump administration granted a license that unfroze some of Gertler’s money held in U.S. institutions, including Deutsche Bank, and allowed his companies to re-enter the financial system. The reprieve angered civil society who have long reported on Gertler’s alleged corruption. It surprised U.S. officials, according to a New York Times investigation of the lobbying, which involved Alan Dershowitz, who later served as a lawyer to President Trump.Last month, journalists reported that companies linked to Gertler bypassed U.S. sanctions with the help of one of Central Africa’s largest banks. The investigation was organized by the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa, which previously provided ICIJ with more than 700,000 documents that formed the basis of the Luanda Leaks investigation.As early as 2001, the United Nations linked Gertler to the “illegal exploitation” of valuable DRC resources. Gertler, who has close ties to former DRC President Joseph Kabila, owned a company that received a lucrative diamond-mining monopoly, U.N. reports alleged. Gertler agreed to exchange diamonds for the delivery of weapons to Congolese armed forces, according to the U.N. panel. Gertler rejected the findings and said his company complied with its obligations.In 2017, as part of the Paradise Papers investigation, ICIJ and media partners revealed how Swiss multinational Glencore, one of the world’s largest commodity traders, discussed appointing Gertler to “negotiate with the DRC authorities” after officials pushed back on a deal for valuable copper deposits. The revelations showed Glencore provided a $45 million loan to a Gertler-controlled company while the tycoon helped Glencore seal a deal with the DRC government.Glencore denied wrongdoing and said that its background checks on Gertler were “extensive and thorough.” Responding to ICIJ’s questions, Gertler hired lawyers in three countries and sent a 33-page letter that claimed accusations of criminal behavior were false.Senior reporter and Africa coordinatorHelp us change the world.

franc to lose 40 percent of its value in the past year.Global Witness said a key cause of discontent with the regime was the chronic lack of funding by the government in basic services such as schools, hospitals and roads.The main culprit in the diversion of funds was Gecamines, a state-owned company tasked with the exploration, research and production of Congo’s mineral deposits, its report said.Gecamines is “haemorrhaging money in suspect transactions … while simultaneously failing to make any substantial contribution to the national treasury or invest in its own mining operations,” the report said. Congo’s “secretive” tax agencies, meanwhile, “keep back a portion of mining revenues for their ‘own funds’ rather than transfer it to the treasury,” it added.\\xa0The missing revenues rise to\\xa0$1.3bn when other state bodies and a now-defunct provincial tax body were included, it said.Lambert Mende, a spokesman for Kabila, said the judiciary would deal with corruption cases. “We have institutions in charge of handling such cases. The courts are working and if it’s true that money from mining revenues is being embezzled, those involved will be brought to court and be prosecuted,” Mende told the DPA news agency.More than two million voters expected to elect National Assembly members as well as local councils.Violence between troops and armed fighters in the DR Congo has killed thousands of people since August.Follow Al Jazeera English:Sign up for our newsletter.Quality journalism.

The People\\'s Republic of China (PRC) shares ideological bonds with many African countries because of early ties to anti-colonial struggles and through the Non-Aligned Movement. Every African country recognizes the PRC with the exception of eSwatini (Swaziland), which has diplomatic relations with Taiwan). Many African countries preserved trade relations with Beijing after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, and those commercial links have only grown stronger. China has been Africa\\'s leading trading partner since surpassing the United States in 2009.Criticisms have focused on adverse environmental impacts, violations of labor laws and human rights, and corrupt practices.Many African governments seek Chinese assistance through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to bridge the continent\\'s infrastructure gap, while China in turn seeks access to a number of key strategic resources, including fossil fuels, minerals, and also access largely untapped markets. In addition to being rich in natural resources, some African countries attract Chinese interest because of relatively cheap labor, poor governance, and lax environmental standards. In 2017, McKinsey reported that more than 10,000 Chinese companies are likely operating throughout Africa.The amount of money involved is staggering. According to a 2021 report from the Shanghai University of International Business and Economics, China has since 2000 invested a total of $47 billion throughout Africa (in 52 out of 54 countries), with new investments adding up to $2.96 billion in 2020 (an increase of over $200 million from the previous year). The vast majority of Chinese investment—87 percent—has been concentrated in four sectors: energy, transport, metals, and real estate. China\\'s Export-Import Bank provides much of the financing for infrastructure projects in Africa, but a number of commercial banks have also established branches throughout the continent.Yet, despite these numbers, Africa attracted only 2 percent of Chinese foreign investment in 2019.The impact of Chinese economic interactions with Africa can also be measured at an individual level. \"There are no individuals in Nigeria who don\\'t have Chinese goods,\" reports Tijani Abdulkareem, the executive director of the Socio-Economic Research and Development Centre in Abuja. \"It\\'s the food that they eat, the wristwatches they own, the clothes that they wear.\"China\\'s footprint in Africa, however, has caused considerable anger, resentment, and pushback from communities in and around the projects that China has financed, constructed, or promoted, particularly those involving extraction industries. Criticisms have focused on adverse environmental impacts, violations of labor laws and human rights, and corrupt practices.In a webinar entitled Voices from Africa: Activist Perspectives on Chinese Investments, sponsored by the Africa Climate Justice Group, six representatives from civil society organizations around Africa provided their on-the-ground perspective on Chinese activities in mining and extraction in their community followed by commentary from an expert on Chinese investments in Africa. The following report is a synthesis of their presentations.Infrastructure ProjectsChina has invested in a number of high-profile infrastructure projects throughout the continent, including a $7 billion oil pipeline in Niger, a $1.3 billion port project in Cameroon, and a $3.6 billion investment into the aluminum sector in Guinea. Many of these projects are designed to facilitate access to raw materials and speed their export via roads, rail, or port.China is also off-shoring its manufacturing capacities: because of their negative environmental impact, to reduce China\\'s own carbon footprint, and to take advantage of lower labor costs and proximity to raw materials. Africa needs to create labor-intensive manufacturing at the same time that China is hoping to decrease that manufacturing.In Nigeria, Tijani Abdulkareem points out, 218 Chinese firms are involved in everything from the construction industry to the food and beverage sector. Big-ticket infrastructure projects include the $5.8 billion hydroelectric Mambilla Dam, a $2.8 billion gas pipeline, a $1.5 billion harbor complex, and a $200 million airport serving Abuja.In Guinea, reports Aboubacar Diallo of the Centre du Commerce in Conakry, China is providing $20 billion in infrastructure funding in exchange for mining concessions, an agreement that will last from 2017 to 2036. China has already invested in several hydropower plants. But the focus of its interest now is access to critical ores like iron and bauxite as well as a refinery to turn that bauxite into aluminum and a port to export the metal. In exchange, China has pledged to reconstruct a major road at the cost of $2.1 billion, rebuild four universities at a cost of $300 million, rehabilitate roads and sanitation in the capital of Conakry, and set up an electricity grid for $250 million. Only the road has been started, however, and the other three major projects have been delayed.One of the biggest proposed projects that China is spearheading on the continent is the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone in the Limpopo region of South Africa, which the government approved in 2016. Contracts have been awarded to a subsidiary of the Chinese firm Shenzhen Hoi Mor and nine other Chinese companies totally more than $10 billion in investments. This industrial development zone will center around processing minerals such as chrome, manganese, and iron as well as the manufacture of cement and steel. Providing power to the zone is a proposed 3.3-gigawatt coal-fired plant.In some African countries, however, infrastructure is conspicuously absent from the picture. Zimbabwe, mostly smaller scale Chinese companies have been involved in the mining sector. But as Farai Maguwu of the Centre for Natural Resource Governance in Harare points out, the Chinese \"don\\'t build anything in the area. They simply dig and leave behind open pits. There\\'s no investment in education or in road infrastructure, which they destroy using their machinery.\"The experience in South Sudan, where China has been developing oil fields since the 1990s, has been similar. \"The communities are supposed to benefit from the oil being produced in their area,\" observes Pach Ayuen Pach of the Heart of Mother Earth Foundation. \"It\\'s their right, but there are no good schools, no clean water, no roads, no hospitals, and nothing good for the community.\"Environmental ImpactThe environmental impact of Chinese investments depends on the nature of project, the behavior of Chinese firms, and the laws and enforcement of the host country.Chinese financing arms—the Ministry of Commerce, the Export-Import Bank—have environmental regulations on the books. But if you look closely, there are very few regulations and they largely apply to administrative processes. Chinese administrative agencies have to comply with regulations when they review investments, but there no laws to force them to screen these investments. There are no Environmental Impact Assessment requirements, no requirement of disclosure of Chinese overseas conduct.National environmental protection laws and oversight mechanisms vary widely across the continent. South Africa has perhaps the strongest environmental regulations on the books. For instance, NGO activists won a court case to shut down a proposed coal-fired plant in Mpumalanga province in July 2020. \"In South Africa, we do have legislation that helps us stop carbon-intensive projects,\" says David Tshidzumba of Save Our Limpopo Valley Environment.But so far activists have been unable to stop the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone on the grounds of environmental impact, largely because such SEZs are exempt from the usual environmental regulations. South Africa, Tshidzumba explains, is a water-scarce country and the site of the SEZ \"is one of the most water-scarce regions in the country.\" The industrial zone will need 80 million cubic liters of water per year, but it remains unclear where this water will come from. Also troubling is that the project will contribute a full 15 percent to South Africa\\'s carbon budget even as the government has agreed to reduce carbon emissions. \"If it goes ahead, South Africa will be on its backfoot,\" Tshidzumba continues. \"And we\\'ll probably see sanctions against South Africa because of this project.\" The Environmental Impact Assessment of the economic zone is still ongoing, but \"the Chinese speak of the project as if it is already been given the go-ahead.\"In Guinea, where Chinese investments have been concentrated in bauxite and iron industries, the mining has had tremendous impact on the land. \"Local law requires restoration of the land,\" Aboubacar Diallo reports, \"but none of it has been rehabilitated.\" Guinea also has mining laws that require compensation for land taken for such operations, yet companies have seized arable land and displaced people without providing compensation. Rice is the major crop, occupying nearly one-third of the arable land, but the discharge of lubricants and waste water from bauxite mining has compromised this food production. Dust from the mining has polluted the air, and there has been sound pollution as well from blasting and the use of heavy equipment.Sometimes the environmental impact stems from not only ostensibly legal projects but also illegal operations. Reporters in Nigeria, for instance, have exposed the pollution connected to illegal logging, fishing, and mining done either by Chinese entities or by local actors who then sell to Chinese firms. The impacts include \"increased flooding, erosion, the extinction of animals and plants,\" says Tijani Abdulkareem. \"Illegal logging denies communities sources of food and livelihood.\"Illegal fishing and mining are a problem as well in Madagascar, where China is a major trade partner. \"The Chinese use mercury for gold exploration even though it\\'s prohibited,\" reports Volahery Andriamanantenansoa of the Center for Research and Support for Alternatives to Development—Indian Ocean. \"The Malagasy government doesn\\'t have the means to do anything about it.\"But the principal mining interest China now has in Madagascar is rare earth minerals. Reducing the mining of these minerals in China itself, because of adverse effects on environment and health, Beijing is eager to find other sources of these critical inputs into high-tech products. In Madagascar, China expects to extract from 300-800 tons of rare earth minerals during the pilot phase of its extraction. But the removal of only one ton of such minerals generates 1,000 tons of contaminated water and 2,000 tons of toxic waste. Over the full lifetime of the project, which could be 40-50 years, that would total an astonishing 500 million tons of poisoned water and one billion tons of toxic waste. \"This is simply catastrophic,\" Volahery says. The mining will have a devastating impact on the rich biodiversity of the region, adversely affect the tourism sector, and undermine key agricultural products like vanilla and coffee.The mining company has \"promised to use less devastating technique,\" she continues, \"but they don\\'t have experience in rare earth mining.\" And even though these companies are well aware of the environmental impact this kind of mining has had in China, they are turning a blind eye to the consequences in Madagascar.In South Sudan, meanwhile, \"the Chinese are not observing international environmental standards,\" reports Pach Ayuen Pach, and their operations in the oil sector are \"causing air, water, and soil pollution,\" including the emission of gasses through diesel engine generators, the evaporation of gases from burrow pit, and the emission of unburned gasses at the field processing facilities. \"The oil industry in South Sudan has left a landscape pocked with hundreds of open waste pits along with water and soil contaminated by toxic chemicals,\" he concludes.Labor ImpactThe infrastructure projects and mining concessions are supposed to generate not only revenue for African governments but also jobs for local workers. African countries like South Africa, Nigeria, and Namibia have the highest rates of unemployment in the world at 33-34 percent.In many cases, Chinese firms have resisted hiring locally and has instead brought in their own workers from China. By the end of 2019, 182,000 Chinese were working Africa, many of them on construction projects. According to McKinsey, however, Chinese firms rely on Africans for nearly 90 percent of the jobs.Conditions at those jobs vary. At one factory in Zimbabwe, Farai Maguwu reports, \"workers allege that they are locked up during lunch hour. The Chinese say, \\'if we leave you free, you will steal.\\' They are only released after lunch hour. We have also seen Chinese discharge firearms where workers are demanding a minimum wage.\"Pach Ayuen Pach has been tasked with monitoring health and safety conditions for workers at the UNI Afro oil company in South Sudan. The Chinese company has largely ignored the South Sudanese labor laws. So, for instance, workers labor nine hours a day, seven days a week, 30 days a month. \"Employees have no option,\" he points out. \"It is either work or a pay cut, or dismissal. People in this regard choose to work even if it is against their personal health.\" The food provided lacks vegetables aside from raw onions; accommodation for Sudanese workers is of lesser quality than where Chinese workers stay. Workers are entitled to a month off every three months but at half-pay, which discourages them from taking the time off. The language barrier complicates all of these interactions.In South Africa, the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone will reportedly create as many as 53,000 jobs at the site plus many more in supporting industries. To get those jobs, the South African government has promised to apply special treatment such as tax-exemption and a waiver of import duties to the Chinese companies operating there, which means a considerable drop in government revenue.\"Whenever we try to delve into the details of the job creation,\" David Tshidzumba reports, \"we\\'re given the silent treatment. We need more transparency. Our laws afford us the opportunity to get that information.\"Lack of AccountabilityOne of the challenges of dealing with Chinese companies is the lack of transparency and clear lines of accountability. Some of that has to do with linguistic and cultural gaps. But it also reflects a certain pattern of corporate behavior.Even when communities and civil groups raise concerns with Chinese companies in Guinea—for instance about the violation of laws or rights—\"the companies continue to move ahead with impunity,\" observes Aboubacar Diallo. \"When a community contacts the World Bank, they are able to have recourse. That\\'s not the case with any Chinese company.\"\"Chinese companies don\\'t do business like other multinationals do,\" agrees Tijani Abdulkareem. \"Even when we raise issues of environmental degradation, they don\\'t care what civil society says. China made a commitment at the UN General Assembly to support clean energy. We have to step up our game to hold them to their commitments.\"In the case of rare earth mining in Madagascar, the company Reenova has deliberately avoided transparency to boost profits. Although Chinese in origin and based in Singapore, Reenova is registered in Mauritius in order to take advantage of a tax reduction agreement between that island and Madagascar. It was issued a permit for \"research\" in 2003 and, despite the prohibition against selling minerals extracted during such a period, company documents filed on the Singapore stock exchange suggest that it indeed plans to sell up to 800 tons of material mined during this pilot phase. Moreover, the company hasn\\'t consulted with the affected communities, offering only information about the purported benefits of the project and resorting to threats when the community remains unconvinced.In Zimbabwe, where the mining operations are smaller scale, the companies often have no physical address at all, not even a website. Still, they maintain close relations with the Zimbabwean government. In one case, the government sent out state security forces on behalf of a Chinese company to bulldoze a site in a community that clearly was opposed to coal mining. When the community continued to insist that the Chinese company leave, \"the Chinese instructed the government that the community leader be put in jail and barred from visiting the community for four months,\" Farai Maguwu reports.In another case, Maguwu asked the Zimbabwean parliament to investigate a Chinese company that was mining diamonds in partnership with the Zimbabwean defense industry. The Chinese were arguing that they were just in the \"exploration\" phase even though the same company \"had mined in the country from 2011 to 2015 before the former president kicked them out,\" Maguwu added. \"They returned in 2018. It doesn\\'t make sense that they are now doing \\'exploration.\\'\"CorruptionOne obvious way that Chinese companies have gotten around environmental and labor laws and maintained both a lack of accountability and transparency has been by bribing or otherwise paying off officials.In Jigawa, one of the poorest Nigerian states, Chinese businesses can with impunity seize land being farmed by community members because \"local politicians who have been bribed don\\'t care,\" notes Tijani Abdulkareem. \"Most of the officials have been bribed. In these states where there is high state of banditry, a Chinese businessman can bribe to get whatever he wants.\"The same applies to Nigerian businessmen who act on behalf of Chinese companies. One such businessman, nicknamed \"Dan China,\" presided over illegal mines that extracted $278 billion in lead, zinc, tin, and other ores. \"Protected by bribed security agents and local officials, Dan China allegedly smuggled the illegally mined ore to China via the port of Lagos,\" Abdulkareem recounts. In 2017, in an unusual anti-corruption effort, \"the Nigerian government cracked down on one of the largest of these illegal mining operations at Kampanin Zurak, a rural area about 150 miles outside the state capital, Jos. During the raid, police arrested sixteen Chinese nationals working at the remote site.\"In their eagerness to supply Chinese buyers, illegal loggers and fishers are deforesting Nigeria and depleting fishing supplies along the coast, again protected by local officials who have been bought off. Nigeria loses an estimated $70 million annually from illegal fishing alone. \"In July 2017, Sinopec-owned Addax paid $32 million to settle Swiss legal charges that the company had paid up to $100 million in bribes to Nigerian government officials via middlemen,\" Abdulkareem reports.Similar levels of corruption accompany mining operations in Guinea. In 2020, Israeli-French mining magnate Beny Steinmetz and two others stood accused in a Swiss court of paying $10 million in bribes to acquire access to the lucrative iron deposits in Guinea. Earlier corruption charges were dropped when Steinmetz relinquished the iron mining contracts. The government subsequently gave the contract to a Chinese-Singapore-Guinean joint venture, which has promised a rail link and a deep-water port to transport the ore to global markets.In Zimbabwe, the Chinese business owners \"give the impression that they are protected by someone in high office who has given them the permission to do what they please,\" Farai Maguwu reports. \"When communities oppose mines, the state will react, arresting Zimbabweans to protect the Chinese.\"Cultural ImpactMines and infrastructure projects don\\'t just have economic and environmental impact. They also have consequences for the social and cultural life of the communities where they are sited.In the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone in South Africa, for instance, \"the sacred animals and trees of the Venda people will be destroyed when making way for this project,\" says David Tshidzumba. \"They will exhume graves that are more than 60 years old, uproot trees sacred to indigenous people. Once you destroy the land, once you take away the water, we don\\'t have a sense of belonging. It\\'s not just heritage but also livelihood, our way of life.\"Mining projects in Zimbabwe have involved the appropriation of communal land, including drilling in gravesites. \"I don\\'t think there is anywhere in the world where there has been such a blatant violation of cultural rights as is happening in Zimbabwe,\" says Farai Maguwu. At one granite stone mining site, the Chinese company Heijin told villagers that the operation would go forward because they didn\\'t own the land. The Zimbabwean government, meanwhile, tried to downplay the number of villagers affected by the operation.Looking AheadCivil society activists have mounted campaigns against a variety of Chinese-financed extraction projects throughout Africa. They are pursuing legal strategies to prevent the Musina-Makhado zone from getting green-lighted. They are working with impacted communities to disseminate information about environmental impact, expose examples of corruption, and put pressure on governments to abide by local laws when dealing with Chinese companies. They want to establish greater transparency and accountability around Chinese projects and more durable mechanisms that can responsibly handle the complaints of workers and community members. And they are emphasizing non-extractive projects—sustainable agriculture, ecotourism, clean energy—that can provide comparable economic benefits without the devastating impact on the environment and the community.With Western firms, African activists can pursue actions against companies in the host country\\'s judicial system. But, China doesn\\'t have an independent judiciary. Corporate social responsibility became part of Chinese contract law in 2006 and entered into force in 2014, but companies don\\'t necessarily uphold such principles. Although Beijing established a court in 2018 under the authority of the Supreme People\\'s Court to handle international claims arising from the Belt and Road Initiative, it\\'s unclear how independent this judicial body will be.China is, however, increasingly concerned about its reputation. It has provided $60 billion in foreign aid and devoted $1 billion of its Belt and Road Initiative to African infrastructure. It wants to be seen as helping Africa not exploiting it.Recently, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo suspended a number of Chinese companies for illegal mining activities and Beijing responded by ordering the companies to leave the region and promising sanctions if the companies are found guilty of violations. This case demonstrates that the Chinese government is sensitive to public backlash.China has long maintained that it will not interfere with the sovereignty of the countries where it is economically involved. On this question of self-determination, then, African stakeholders perhaps have their greatest leverage. If they can publicize complaints, mobilize discontent, and persuade governments to take action, as in the DRC case, then China can be persuaded to change course, if not to uphold principles of corporate responsibility then to respect the sovereign will of the population and protect whatever remains of China\\'s international reputation.

Cobalt production in Congo is also marked by human rights abuses, including child labor at the mines, well documented by Amnesty International and others. Because of the devastating impact the sourcing of cobalt for the products we buy has on Congolese citizens, urgent action is required to shine a light on the insidious linkages in Congo’s cobalt trade, to help alter the incentive structure away from violence, corruption and human rights abuses and towards a transparent, peaceful and responsible supply chain.  Throughout 2017 and 2018, my colleagues at the Enough Project have conducted field and supply chain research on potential links between corruption, violence, human rights violations, and cobalt mining in Congo. As a result of this research, the Enough Project will be publishing two reports—this being the first—that highlight perspectives from the two ends of the supply chain.  This first report focuses on observations and recommendations from within Congo, including Congolese cobalt and copper miners in both the artisanal and industrial sectors, domestic traders, civil society activists, and local government representatives. We wanted to start by understanding the perspectives of those most impacted by the global cobalt trade. The second report will highlight the actions – current and potential – being taken by those profiting from and otherwise benefiting from Congo’s cobalt, including both companies and their customers.  Both reports will incorporate perspectives from stakeholders throughout the supply chain, because all of these stakeholders have distinct perspectives and needs, and the changes that are needed ultimately implicate all involved. This research is meant to serve as a complement to other studies on Congo’s cobalt sector conducted by colleague organizations such as Amnesty International, the Carter Center, and Global Witness.  It should be noted as well that cobalt mining occurs almost exclusively in tandem with or as a byproduct of copper mining. Copper is used in a wide variety of construction, transportation, defense technology, and machinery worldwide. In 2017, the National Mining Association reported that copper was the second most used mineral by the U.S. Department of Defense. Given this global industrial criticality, many of the contracts currently coveted for their cobalt production in Congo were first established mainly for their copper potential, before the surge in international demand for cobalt. Therefore, many of the findings and recommendations in this report can also be strategically applied to copper industry stakeholders in Congo and throughout the supply chain.  In addition to the reports, the Enough Project will also be launching an associated campaign to engage activists and consumers on policies that counter corruption, violence, and human rights abuses connected to Congo’s cobalt trade. The campaign will focus on highlighting opportunities for companies to become leaders on these issues, especially through the approaches to be detailed more thoroughly in the second report in this series.John Prendergast Founding Director Enough Project',\n",

It is even faster outside Harare because of smaller crowds and there is not too many law enforcement officials,\"The operation is quite sophisticated. The touts start by vetting their \\'prey\\' to avert any risk of being arrested either by the law enforcement agents or by members of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) who are deployed at the offices.A visit to the Bindura registrar\\'s office revealed that most of passport seekers there are mostly from Harare. One long distance haulage truck driver, Onesmo Zimuto, explained how he managed to have his passport renewed.\"My passport had run out of pages,\" said Zimuto. \"I had challenges renewing it in Harare because of the long queues. As I was about to give up when I was approached by one young man who referred me to this lady who works here. I submitted my papers on a Monday and on Thursday I collected my passport.\"I have since created a good working relationship with the lady. I am now processing this passport for my workmate whose passport is due to expire next month and is on duty in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\"On my passport I paid US$250 including the fee for the middlemen. Because of the cordial relationship now existing I have now paid US$180. I have been told she will call me once it is out probably Thursday or Friday.\"Early this year, Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister, Kazembe Kazembe, was quoted in the media as having said that the Government was about to institute investigations.\"During my tour of the Bindura Passport Office,\" said Kazembe, \"I noticed that almost 90 percent of the people that were being assisted there had come from Harare. The queue was also moving very slowly and I couldn\\'t understand what was going on. We are going to conduct our own investigations and I\\'m confident that we are going to apprehend those that are engaging in these nefarious activities.\"Despite the threat of investigation money continues to change hands between citizens and the officials. Meanwhile members of the public have called on the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) to intervene.Asked if ZACC had received reports on corruption at the Registrar General\\'s office, ZACC spokesperson, Commissioner John Makamure said the commission carries investigations once there are complaints.Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inboxBy submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.Almost finished...We need to confirm your email address.To complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just sent you.There was a problem processing your submission.

With only a paltry 100 applicants being served a day, desperate applicants are left with no option but to pay the higher fee.A passport is arguably the most coveted official document one can hope to obtain as it is the gateway to the so called greener pastures outside the borders of Zimbabwe for many for thousands of citizens.*This story is published under the Voluntary Media Council of Zimbabwe (VMCZ) Investigative Journalism Fund with support from the European Union.Kazembe Kazembe The Voluntary Media Council of Zimbabwe (VMCZ)Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZAAC)Read the original article on 263Chat.AllAfrica publishes around 700 reports a day from more than 100 news organizations and over 500 other institutions and individuals, representing a diversity of positions on every topic.

independent journalism': '‘Everyone will be shocked.’Correspondent and Editor, AfricaInvestigations EditorA review of fraud and corruption risks in the Democratic Republic of Congo – one of the world’s longest-running humanitarian crises – delivers a blistering assessment that could spark major changes to aid operations in a country where hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign aid are spent annually.The 70-page draft review – circulated last month to aid officials working in Congo and obtained by The New Humanitarian – looks at everything from corruption within the Ebola response to how women and girls are subjected to sexual exploitation. It also details how donor funds are siphoned off and how aid recipients ultimately lose out.The office of UN Secretary-General António Guterres is aware of the review, spokeswoman Zoe Paxton told TNH. “Once the report is published, we will carefully consider any recommendations made,” she said.The operational review was commissioned by an anti-fraud taskforce created by UN agencies and aid groups in Congo after the NGO Mercy Corps discovered a fraud scheme in late 2018 –\\xa0first made public this week by TNH – that raised the alarm about widespread corruption and problems with the systems designed to root it out.\\xa0The review was shared with TNH by a senior aid official working in Congo who expressed dissatisfaction with how the humanitarian sector is managing fraud and corruption risks. It comes at a time when pressure on aid budgets around the world is set to rise due to a recession and the demands of COVID-19 sucking up cash reserves.Carried out by three international consultants and two Congolese researchers contracted by Adam Smith International, an aid consultancy – and funded with a grant from the UK\\'s government aid agency, DFID – the operational review, for which more than 400 people were interviewed, doesn’t take a position on the Mercy Corps case but confirms many of its findings.\\xa0It notes how networks of fraudsters have embedded themselves within humanitarian organisations and introduced a dizzying number of corrupt practices that impact everything from the recruitment of staff to the procurement of supplies and the delivery of aid. UN agencies in particular are cited.It also notes that the systems designed to detect fraud often fail, and that anti-corruption tools and guidelines are rarely used. Aid organisations are also reluctant to share information that could offer valuable lessons, it says.\\xa0“Learning from investigations is currently limited to the organisations themselves and their donors,” the document states. “Even for this review, lessons learned from such investigations have not been made available by donors or UN organisations.”While interviews for the review were held from January to April this year, it is unclear how long some of the practices it flags have been taking place.\\xa0“Everyone will be shocked,” said Joseph Inganji, the head of the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, OCHA, in Congo. He said the fraud noted in the review was distressing because the humanitarian sector was there to help and save lives.DFID, a major donor to humanitarian aid in Congo, said it had provided funding for the review because it is committed to tackling fraud and corruption, but refused to comment on the findings and recommendations until a final version is published later this month.Read how the UN reacted to this investigation →International aid analyst Charles Kenny of the Center for Global Development think tank cautioned that the review can’t tell the whole story.Relying on anecdotal information, it “doesn’t allow for an estimate of how pervasive corruption is in humanitarian relief aid in the DRC”, he said. Kenny told TNH he would value a follow-up survey of intended aid recipients to ask what they actually received.Diego Zorrilla, a senior UN official in Congo who works on the anti-fraud taskforce that commissioned the review, said the draft is not an exhaustive investigation but gives “clues of what could be happening”.Zorrilla said the review had only been circulated among members of the taskforce, and that he could not comment on how recommendations would be implemented before consulting the wider humanitarian community after a final version is submitted. Comments on specific findings were being sent back to the authors as part of the review process, he added.“This is not specific to the DRC. The only thing that is going to stop it is a systemic approach.”Asked about the broader situation – without mentioning the scam involving Mercy Corps or the draft review – Ernest Mpararo, of the Congolese League Against Corruption, blamed a “lack of monitoring and control” in humanitarian organisations for allowing fraud to spread, but pointed out that corruption is pervasive in Congo, where the president’s chief of staff is currently standing trial on graft charges.Other anti-corruption experts told TNH the draft review should be a wake-up call, not just for the aid sector in Congo but also for humanitarian organisations in other countries with long-running relief operations.“This is not specific to the DRC,” Tim Boyes-Watson at Humentum, an association that advises member NGOs, said after looking at the draft review provided by TNH. “The only thing that is going to stop it is a systemic approach.”Read our related investigation on the aid scam that spurred the review → EXCLUSIVE: Congo aid scam triggers sector-wide alarmResearcher Nisar Majid, of the London School of Economics, said the corruption described in the report was “very similar” to that found in his research on aid to Somalia.\\xa0“These issues shouldn\\'t be a surprise,” he said. However, “throughout the system, from top to bottom, we struggle to address it and talk about it.\"Corruption involving contracts between international aid groups and national NGOs is described in the report as particularly egregious, with local organisations sometimes expected to provide kickbacks that can amount to more than 10 percent of a contract value. Workers at UN agencies are most cited for being associated with the practice.One person interviewed for the review alleged that the selection committee of Congo’s humanitarian pooled fund –\\xa0a major pot run by OCHA – had demanded kickbacks from national NGOs in exchange for contracts.Inganji, the OCHA country director, described the allegation as “serious” but said the funding process is “transparent”. He said an investigation into the allegations had not yet been launched.“The end result of these pressures was described as reducing impact of aid for aid recipients, adding pressures to a difficult local market, and increasing food insecurity.”Allegations of corruption were also noted in procurement processes: interviewees told the review that suppliers “expect” to provide kickbacks to staff of NGOs and UN agencies of 10 to 30 percent of the contract value. Some suppliers said they had responded by fixing higher prices for aid groups.The seed sector appears to be particularly affected, according to people interviewed for the review who claimed that procurers often take a slice of the tonnage to sell privately. Insiders were said to replace seeds intended for distribution with lesser quality alternatives, the draft review notes, pointing to staff at UN agencies as among the worst offenders.“The end result of these pressures was described as reducing impact of aid for aid recipients, adding pressures to a difficult local market, and increasing food insecurity,” the review states.Representatives of national NGOs and suppliers told the review’s authors they believed that flagging corrupt practices would get them blocked from future contracts or partnerships with aid agencies. Both described a blacklist collectively enforced by some workers at different aid groups –\\xa0most often UN agencies – for those who “disturb the system”.Offering jobs in exchange for sex is “widely practiced” in the country, the review finds. There are also reports of aid recipients being expected to provide “sexual favours” for workers in exchange for their names being added to distribution lists.\\xa0Very few cases of sexual abuse and exploitation (SEA) involving aid workers, however, are ever reported – partially because hotlines and locked suggestion boxes meant for reporting abuse or corruption are ineffective.\\xa0“We hear a lot of talk – NGO and UN have zero tolerance policies; however, we do not see any consequences for [abusers] when they occur.”“[The complaints mechanisms] appear to produce no information with regards to occurring cases of sexual exploitation and abuse,” the review states, taking particular aim at the ineffectiveness of hotlines.One Congolese NGO staffer told the reviewers: “We hear a lot of talk – NGO and UN have zero tolerance policies; however, we do not see any consequences for [abusers] when they occur.”Women and girls, who “have neither access to [a] phone nor the privacy to use their husbands’ or family phone”, face particular challenges, the review notes.\\xa0It also highlights that perpetrators use “money, influence, and positions to keep survivors and their families quiet”, and are rarely punished.Survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation are often young – most often between 14 and 22 – and members of some of the most vulnerable communities in the country, including IDPs and orphans, the review notes. The authors recommend that more funding go to national organisations that work closely with survivors of abuse and gender-based violence.Ongoing corruption has caused a mutual lack of trust between the aid sector and local communities, who “perceive humanitarian aid as corrupt and driven by external agendas”, according to the draft review.\\xa0Similarly, aid groups have become equally jaded, the review suggests, hindering cooperation with local authorities and community leaders who regularly demand a share of project budgets.\\xa0In particular, the alert systems that are supposed to help communities report displacements to aid groups following conflicts or natural disasters pose a high risk of corruption, according to the document.Local leaders, authorities, and militia members can use the systems to fabricate population movements or exaggerate the number of people displaced – usually in collusion with staff members of aid organisations.\\xa0“This may lead to the allocation of aid in areas where it is either not needed, or less needed,” the review notes. “Consequently, vulnerable populations remain excluded and under-assisted and potential benefit is lost.”The UN’s Zorrilla said humanitarian organisations have improved their alert systems in recent months by introducing a process whereby data is more thoroughly analysed.Some IDPs who spoke to the authors reported having to pay bribes to be registered for aid, while those registered for support may receive reduced amounts, or no aid at all, the review says.Distrust between communities and relief workers has been\\xa0particularly pronounced in the Ebola-affected areas of Beni and Butembo, where vast sums of money have been pumped\\xa0into a single space, amplifying many of the underlying corruption risks described in the report.Interviewees told the review’s authors that vehicles belonging to staff of the Ebola response had been rented at “exceptionally” high prices, with cost negotiations sidelined for fast operationality. Military escorts had also been established “at very high costs”, the authors were told.The failure of existing systems to detect corruption and SEA have allowed both to flourish, the draft review concludes.The authors were told that aid workers tasked with evaluating project implementation are paid bribes to submit assessments that hide both corruption and poor performance.The review also notes that some of the corrupt practices appeared “audit proof” – the technique, for example, of “ghost” recipients is too hard to check. Those involved in audit processes could also potentially manipulate the results, the document states.Members of aid groups, meanwhile, described fraud reporting processes “as cumbersome and time-consuming”, with some lacking a dedicated compliance and anti-fraud department.\\xa0Despite recent improvements in information sharing – including the joint anti-fraud taskforce formed after the Mercy Corps case – the review’s authors note that organisations still don’t talk openly about attempted and confirmed cases of corruption.“There are too many vested interests; it\\'s a hugely complex industry.”Short funding cycles from donors, and an emphasis on speed – in the form of rapid response programmes – have “weakened” the overall quality of response and increased the opportunity for aid funds to be diverted, the review states.Communities, meanwhile, have built in-depth knowledge of the response mechanisms aid groups have used over the years, while the aid groups themselves often lack understanding of the local context and power dynamics.Majid, of the London School of Economics, said the corruption described in the report would require far more than “technical fixes” to solve. “There are too many vested interests; it\\'s a hugely complex industry,” he said.John Githongo, a Kenyan anti-corruption campaigner, said the “exploitation of the most vulnerable members of the population” was the most “disconcerting” finding of the review, which he read for TNH. He said DFID was courageous for having commissioned it, but added: “the real courage, of course, will be in doing something about it.”Additional reporting from Ben Parker in Geneva.pk-pd/bp/agSubscribe to our newsletters to stay up to date with our coverage.It was The New Humanitarian’s investigation with the Thomson Reuters Foundation that uncovered sexual abuse by aid workers during the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of Congo and led the World Health Organization to launch an independent review and reform its practices.This demonstrates the important impact that our journalism can have.\\xa0But this won’t be the last case of aid worker sex abuse. This also won’t be the last time the aid sector has to ask itself difficult questions about why justice for victims of sexual abuse and exploitation has been sorely lacking.\\xa0We’re already working on our next investigation, but reporting like this takes months, sometimes years, and can’t be done alone.The support of our readers and donors helps keep our journalism free and accessible for all.
